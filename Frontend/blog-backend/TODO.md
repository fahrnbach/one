1. Use GitHub Actions or Cron job
Automate backups into your repo or a secure bucket.
```
npx wrangler d1 execute your-db-name --command ".dump" > backup-$(date +%F).sql
```

2. Create a DB → Markdown Export Script
	•	Query each post and its normalized data (tags, categories, etc.)
	•	Convert it into frontmatter + markdown content
	•	Save to /posts/{slug}.md
	•	Use for backups, portability, and Git-based versioning

3.	Add a “Backfill ID” util:
In case you ever need to retro-generate missing IDs from slugs or hashes.

4.✨ Add Zod validation to GraphQL mutations once CMS/admin editing is introduced
Goal: Ensure robust input validation and schema safety for any user-submitted or UI-edited post data.
