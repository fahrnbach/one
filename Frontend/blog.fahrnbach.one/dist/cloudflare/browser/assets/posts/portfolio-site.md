Case Study: Building My Portfolio Site  
===  
<br/>

## Overview

![Homepage Screenshot](/assets/screenshots/portfolio-screenshot.png)

[fahrnbach.one](https://fahrnbach.one) is more than just a portfolio â€” it's an interactive experiment in **futuristic web design** and expressive, minimal interfaces. Built entirely from scratch using **vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**, the project reflects my passion for pushing creative and technical boundaries in the browser.

Rather than rely on frameworks or templates, I used this site as an opportunity to explore **new visual paradigms**, experiment with **Three.js** for subtle interactive elements, and craft something that feels personal, strange, and immersive.

## Goals

- Build a framework-free portfolio site with expressive design and full control
- Explore cutting-edge web visuals through **custom layouts**, **SVG animation**, and **WebGL (via Three.js)**
- Create a timeless and minimal UI that feels futuristic, but stays performant
- Highlight technical depth and creative range without being overwhelming

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Three.js
- **Design Tools**: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Future Plans**: Integration with a CMS + WebXR experimentation

## Design Philosophy

I approached this build as an **art-meets-engineering** challenge. Every detail â€” from the glowing scroll-orbs on desktop, to the snap-scrolling mobile UI, to the floating project panels â€” was hand-built using custom JavaScript and SVG elements.

Rather than follow UI trends, I focused on designing something that felt **visually intuitive but unconventional** â€” a quiet statement on how expressive the open web can still be when design and code are deeply aligned.

The site plays with subtle depth, parallax, and motion, thanks in part to **Three.js**. While usage is currently light, I plan to continue layering more interactive 3D or shader-based elements over time to create truly **next-gen UI experiences**.

## Process

I started in Illustrator, sketching visual themes â€” orbs, gradients, timelines â€” before translating them into SVG assets. I then wrote the layout and animation logic entirely in vanilla JavaScript, using the Intersection Observer API, scroll snapping, and modular functions to manage behavior.

Three.js was brought in for enhanced depth and subtle 3D motion. I explored a few paths including shader effects and particles, and will continue building out that system as the aesthetic evolves.

The mobile and desktop versions are intentionally distinct â€” each with UI optimized for its environment.

## Challenges

- Keeping all interactions and animations smooth without a framework
- Managing DOM complexity and scroll-based effects across devices
- Building a Three.js integration that complements (rather than overwhelms) the flat design
- Achieving high visual fidelity while maintaining performance and fast loading times

## Outcome

The result is a site that stands apart. Itâ€™s simple on the surface, but technically rich underneath. It represents my approach to software development: **hand-crafted, principled, and creatively fearless**.

I see this site as an evolving canvas â€” both for future design systems and for experiments in interaction, WebGL, and digital storytelling.
