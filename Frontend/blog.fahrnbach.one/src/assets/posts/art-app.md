# 🎨 Case Study: Designing My Art App  
<br/>

![Art App Screenshot](/assets/screenshots/art-screenshot.png)
## 🧭 Overview

[art.fahrnbach.one](https://art.fahrnbach.one) is a **desktop-first web experience** built to showcase my visual design capabilities and experimental UI ideas. Originally intended as a social art platform, the project evolved into a deep-dive into **aesthetic precision**, **custom SVG interface design**, and **creative front-end expression**.

The app is built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with every visual element handcrafted in **Adobe Illustrator** and styled with care. It demonstrates my ability to balance artistic vision with performant, standards-based web development.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🎨 Build a visual design showcase without relying on a framework  
- 🧪 Experiment with unconventional UI, color, and layout techniques  
- 🧵 Integrate AI-generated or glitched art with thoughtful editing and placement  
- 💬 Create a novel UI concept (the "Gear Panel") for commenting and feedback  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS  
- **Design Tools**: Illustrator, Photoshop, Glitch Art Tools  
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages  
- **Planned Additions**: Angular rewrite, backend with database, dynamic portfolio filtering  

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This app is a love letter to **weird and beautiful interface design**. Rather than copy templates, I designed every icon, panel, and animation myself — focusing on **visual storytelling**, mood, and tone.

I treated the UI like a gallery wall: every piece needed to stand on its own, but also work in harmony. The layout adapts to wide desktop displays, using generous spacing and precise placement to create a quiet, confident rhythm.

The glitchy and AI-edited images reflect a fascination with digital imperfection — each one altered by hand to better match the mood of the interface.

## 🛠️ Process

I began by creating SVG layouts in Illustrator — iterating over orb shapes, color palettes, and layout motifs. Once satisfied, I moved the assets into code, building modular HTML/CSS blocks to mirror the designs.

Using **vanilla JS**, I implemented custom navigation, hover effects, and a dynamic “Gear Panel” interface that allows viewers to leave feedback or notes directly on pieces (coming soon!).

While there’s currently no backend, the architecture is set up for future expansion into a full app.

## ⚙️ Challenges

- 🧮 Keeping the design pixel-precise across different screen sizes  
- 🧘 Balancing visuals and readability in a desktop-first layout  
- 🧰 Implementing UI entirely by hand without a framework  
- 🪄 Getting AI images to feel cohesive with custom graphics and layout  

## ✅ Outcome

The Art App is a unique expression of my **design principles**, technical confidence, and love of digital art. It’s a place to experiment and explore — a platform I’ll continue evolving as I incorporate Angular, backend features, and more community-focused tools.

This project shows not just what I can build — but **how I think** about the intersection of **design, tech, and meaning**.
