> ⚠️ **Note from Jacob:** I've learned and adapted most of these poses over the years. The names may not be perfect Sanskrit or textbook yoga terms. But that's the point — yoga is about tuning in, not showing off. Do what feels good for *your* body, and keep a calm, curious mind. 🧘‍♂️💻

## 🧘‍♂️ Yoga for Coders: Stretch Your Spine, Save Your Sprint

If you code, you probably sit ![Or Stand](Or Stand) too much. And if you're like me, you’ve probably told yourself, *"I'll stretch after this bug is fixed"* ...only to realize that was six hours ago. This short flow is for those moments — when your neck is stiff, your shoulders ache, and your spine needs a reboot.

I often segue into this after a quick bodyweight circuit (a few squats and pushups), and it works *really* well if you end that workout in a pushup — you're already in position for the first move!

## ONE: Child → Viper Pose  
**Good for:** Neck, upper back, shoulders  
**Funny name:** `git reset --soft HEAD~1`

This is actually a two-pose combo I always do together.

### 🧎 Child Pose
- Start kneeling on the floor.
- Reach both arms forward and place your hands on the ground.
- Sit back onto your calves, and lower your head toward your knees.
- Breathe deep — the more you reach your head toward the floor, the better the stretch.

### 🐍 Viper Pose (Upward Dog Variant)
- From Child Pose, shift forward into a pushup position.
- Let your hips sink to the floor and lift your chest up.
- Arch your spine, point your chin up, and gaze at the ceiling.
- Inhale fully, then exhale and gently release.

🌀 Alternate slowly between Child and Viper poses 3–5 times to melt away upper back tension.

## TWO: Prayer Twist (aka Twisted Lunge) 🙏  
**Good for:** Neck, spine, glutes, thighs, calves  
**Funny name:** `div.innerFlex()`

- Start standing with feet together.
- Step your right leg forward and left leg back into a lunge.
- Plant your right hand next to your right foot.
- Extend your left hand toward the ground, then rotate and reach it skyward.
- Follow your fingertips with your eyes 👀
- Take a full breath at the top, then slowly lower your arm.

🔁 Switch sides and repeat 1–3 times per side. Bonus: Sprinkle in your next pose below as a mid-lunge transition!

## THREE: Standing Forward Fold (aka Uttanasana)  
**Good for:** Lower back, neck, calves  
**Funny name:** `return_to_main()`

A personal favorite for grounding and clearing your head.

- Stand tall with your hands at your chest.
- Inhale, then exhale and fold at the waist.
- Let your arms hang or reach for the floor.
- Inhale as you slowly rise and reset.

### One-legged Variant:
- Stand on your left leg and raise your right leg behind you as you fold forward.
- Balance by bending your standing leg slightly.

🌬️ Use this as a transitional pose between sides during the Prayer Twist.

---

## BONUS FOUR: Modified Bharadvaja’s Twist  
**Good for:** Lower back, glutes, hips  
**Funny name:** `refactor(positionState)`

This is *my favorite* — a deep, calming twist that helps realign everything.

- Sit with both legs outstretched.
- Cross your right leg over your left and place the foot near your left hip.
- Relax the bottom leg.
- Raise both arms forward and twist your torso toward the left.
- Reach your arms around and behind you — feel the stretch!

💡 Listen to your body here. Some cracking is normal — just breathe and don't overdo it.

Switch sides and repeat.

## 🧘‍♂️ Final Thoughts

You don’t have to be flexible or fit to start doing yoga. You just need curiosity, kindness, and maybe a bit of back pain. 😅 Try mixing these poses into your coding day — between Pomodoros, in the morning, or after a tough debugging session.

> Your spine is the frame for your ideas. Keep it strong and soft.

Let me know your favorite coder-yoga pose or code-themed name idea — I’m collecting them. 🙌
