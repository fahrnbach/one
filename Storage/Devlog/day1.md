## Day -1: Testing Static Routes & Dashboard Access
```
ðŸŸ¡ **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Discussed using Loom for update videos.
- Designed a "Loom Hub" concept to visually browse progress + milestones.
- Decided to revamp About tab with a glowing timeline, potentially using Canvas or Three.js.

**Summary:**
This day leaned into storytelling and experience design. By ideating the Loom Hub and a glowing timeline, the focus shifted from infrastructure to how visitors would *feel* when navigating the portfolio. The goal: make exploration visual, memorable, and full of momentum.

**Intent:**
To translate raw technical progress into a form that communicates journey, not just product. These ideas laid the emotional scaffolding for how the site tells its story â€” blending utility, creativity, and narrative flow.
