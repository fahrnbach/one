## 🐛🚫 Day -2: Debugging & Refining Login Flow
```
🟡 **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Refined login JS logic: added `preventDefault()`, corrected input `id` vs. `name`.
- Verified token fetch to protected `/sessions` route.
- Redirected to `/admin/dashboard` on success.

**Summary:**
Today was about tightening the user journey. Key interaction bugs were squashed, and login behavior became more reliable. The system matured past proof-of-concept and into functioning authentication logic — with clean token storage and a proper redirect on success.

**Intent:**
Transform the admin login experience from a wireframe prototype into a real authentication workflow. Ensure tokens persist, error handling works, and the system communicates feedback clearly. Foundation set for deeper UI polish and access control.
