## Day 0: Monorepo Merge & Devlog Begins
```
ðŸŸ¡ **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Merged previously separate projects (admin, genie, etc.) into a single monorepo for better coherence.
- Wrote and published the first retrospective entries in the new Devlog series.
- Finalized Trello board and sync strategy for smoother task tracking.
- Began organizing long-term progress around narrative and timeline.

**Summary:**
This was the first day the project became *visible* â€” both to the public and to itself. By shifting to a monorepo, the architecture aligned with the actual creative flow. At the same time, retrospectives gave shape to the hidden momentum behind the build. Structure met story.

**Intent:**
To unify and surface the work â€” technically, by consolidating repos; contextually, by chronicling effort through daily logs. The result was a shift from stealth mode to structured launch mode, and a foundation for transparency, iteration, and future collaboration.
