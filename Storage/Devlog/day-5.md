## 🔐 Day -5: Email & Authentication Strategy
```
🟡 **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Finalized personal email flow, and Investigated User-Agents
- Explored authentication strategies (bearer token now, JWT later).
- Connected Google Calendar to Calendly to streamline scheduling.
- Discussed integrating Calendly into `fahrnbach.one`.

**Summary:**
This day clarified how users (and admins) would authenticate and how communication and scheduling would flow. It focused on future-proofing the user pipeline: reliable email delivery, a token-based login system, and seamless calendar integration — all in service of a polished, professional experience for both users and potential collaborators.

**Intent:**
Establish trust, ease of use, and administrative clarity by aligning core communication tools with the authentication strategy. These decisions help make the portfolio more than a static showcase — they prepare it for real interactions.
