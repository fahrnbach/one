# 🧩 Case Study: Angular Component Library App  
<br/>

![Angular Component Library Screenshot](/assets/screenshots/library-screenshot.png)
## 🧭 Overview

This app is a **component showcase and sandbox** for a custom Angular library I’ve been building from scratch. Designed with scalability and real-world use in mind, it features dynamic filtering, responsive layout, and thoughtful styling across reusable UI elements.

The goal is to eventually publish a full design system with documentation, themes, and extensibility — but even at ~40% complete, the app already demonstrates a polished developer experience and solid architectural decisions.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🧱 Build a centralized interface to explore and test custom Angular components  
- 🔍 Add live search and filtering by keyword, type, or tag  
- 📦 Keep each component self-contained with SCSS, inputs/outputs, and clean API surfaces  
- 🛠 Lay groundwork for future design-system documentation and theme support  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Angular  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Styling**: SCSS Modules, BEM  
- **Tooling**: Angular CLI, GitHub, VS Code  
- **Planned Features**: Auto-generated docs, Storybook integration, dark mode theming  

## 🧪 Design Philosophy

This project lives at the intersection of **developer UX** and **visual clarity**. Each component is built with reusability in mind, including sensible defaults and clear input/output contracts. I use clean naming conventions and lightweight styles to keep everything predictable.

Visually, the app balances minimalism with clarity — showing off the components without unnecessary clutter. A simple dynamic search input lets you quickly filter the library, and the layout scales well across screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Process

I started by scaffolding a new Angular workspace and setting up a dedicated module for the component library. Each UI element lives in its own folder with an `index.ts`, component file, and styles.

The app dynamically displays each component with its name, usage notes, and live preview area. I implemented a **dynamic search system** using Angular’s reactive forms and filters to quickly surface relevant components.

While still in early stages, I’ve prioritized testable, well-isolated code and maintainable folder structure so the library can scale as new elements are added.

## ⚙️ Challenges

- ⚖️ Balancing flexibility and simplicity in component inputs  
- 🧩 Designing for general use without over-engineering  
- 🧪 Making the preview UI helpful but not overwhelming  
- 📖 Planning for auto-generated documentation and examples  

## ✅ Outcome

This Angular component app serves as both a **testing ground and portfolio** for my UI thinking and TypeScript architecture skills. While it’s a work in progress, it already reflects the care I bring to code organization, reusability, and design-to-dev translation.

Future additions will include:
- 📘 Interactive documentation and usage notes  
- 🎨 Theming support (light/dark/custom)  
- 🧪 Integration testing with standalone builds  
- 💬 A feedback panel for reviewing component UX in context
