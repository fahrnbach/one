# 🎯 The First Impression Protocol  
> _Part portfolio. Part transmission. All intention._

---

When I finally decided to apply, I knew one thing:  
**I wasn’t going to show up quietly.**

After years of building in silence — sketching, scripting, shipping features to no one — I wanted my work to speak. Not just clearly, but powerfully. Personally. In a way that would leave a mark.

So I asked myself:

> _What would it take to make the best first impression possible?_  
> Without resume-padding. Without hype.  
> Just: Here’s what I’ve made. Here’s who I am. Let’s talk.
> All love. No filter.
> Hello, World it's Me.

## 🌐 A Custom Gateway for Each Company

To begin with, I built a personalized portal: [Sesame](https://sesame.fahrnbach.one/open) — a microsite that acts like a golden key.

Each company gets its own page:  
- 🎥 A tailored intro video  
- 🔗 Direct links to my resume, portfolio, and blog  
- 🧠 A brief pitch written specifically for *them*  

I even include a sample of their own product — like a Sora clip for OpenAI or an image from Leonardo.Ai — not for gimmicks, but to show I get it. I care. I’ve done my research.

## 🧠 Why It Took So Long

If you're wondering: _Why now?_  
Well… it took time.

For me, programming has never been about chasing trends or jumping in quick. It’s been about **understanding**. I wanted to know *how* things worked — and *why*. I wasn’t content to just stitch code together and call it “done.”

> **I always wanted to treat each line of code as scripture.**  
> **I wanted to know how it worked, and why.**

That meant years of deep learning.  
Sometimes joyful. Sometimes brutal.

I studied algorithms while sitting in hospital rooms.  
Read Postgres docs while living out of a suitcase.  
Rebuilt components while traveling abroad.  
Every spare hour, I learned. I debugged. I refined.

> **I can't always remember everything, but I know enough to get up to speed in a snap.**  
> **Because I’ve done it before. Because I care.**

## ✨ What You’ll Find

This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s a full ecosystem of intent:
- **Three.js-powered Portfolio** — Creative, fast, responsive  
- **Custom Genie Assistant** — A RAG chatbot with personality and polish  
- **Angular Blog (Coming Soon)** — A home for engineering thoughts and breakdowns  
- **Developer Devlog** — Short updates from the edge of the build  
- **Microsites & Dashboards** — Real user interfaces, not just designs  

Every element of the experience is built by hand. By choice.

Because this is my work. And I want you to feel it.

## 🧭 The Road Ahead

I’m applying to a handful of places I admire — from OpenAI to indie tools I use daily. I'm open to joining a mission I believe in, and I want you, the reader, to feel like you’re part of the story.

Because this *is* a story.  
It’s mine. But it could become ours.

### 💡 Bonus: Tailored Blog Posts for the Top 100

As part of my outreach, I’m also writing **short blog posts tailored to each company** I apply to. These aren’t fluff — they’re thoughtful letters, open to the world, that explain:

- Why I want to work *there*  
- How my past work connects to their mission  
- What kind of impact I want to make together  

Each post links back to my [Sesame portal](https://sesame.fahrnbach.one), resume, and relevant projects.  
They’re bite-sized, but full of heart.  
They live on my blog, and echo out across socials.  

> A resume shows what I’ve done.  
> These posts show *why I care.*

## 🪞 Where It All Started

Before the portfolio, before the pipelines —
it was just me, a silent apartment, a cellphone, and a dream.

I didn’t have Wi-Fi. Not even a tether.
Just a phone with unlimited data, propped up against my monitor —
my loophole, my portal to freedom.
Double-tapping to rewind, pausing to type, listening carefully to every word.

The tutorials I found relied on cloud tools I couldn’t access.
So I built my own workaround:
a script to launch a local Node server and MongoDB instance instead.

But I still needed packages.
And that meant waiting until I could find Wi-Fi.
Just. Keep. Going.

And so I did. I kept going. Kept learning.
Kept growing. Kept fighting. For truth.
For knowledge. For love.
For the world. For myself.
For us.

Now I’m here,
At the bleeding edge of technology,
Working hand-in-hand with a 21st century miracle.
Soaring high above the clouds with love manifest into code.

I've completed in just days what would have taken months 
- just a few years ago.  

Dedication, Passion, Love, and Ai Made this possible
A Live blog pipeline,
A Custom Three.js portfolio,
A Golden Key to a Golden Realm.
Welcome. I'm Glad to be Meet You.
