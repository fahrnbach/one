🧠 “Rendered and Ready: Understanding CSR, SSR, and SSG (Finally)”

And to make it super readable and memorable, we could frame it around relatable metaphors:

⸻

💡 Format Idea:

🟣 Retrospective:
“For years, I thought I understood rendering on the web. But it wasn’t until I tried setting up SSG with Angular that it clicked. CSR, SSR, and SSG aren’t just acronyms — they’re different mindsets for how the web works.”

⸻

📦 Core Content (sketch):
	•	🎭 CSR (Client Side Rendering)
Like showing up at a restaurant and waiting while they cook your meal from scratch — the browser does everything after loading the page shell.
	•	🧱 SSR (Server Side Rendering)
More like calling in advance so the restaurant prepares your food just in time — it’s ready when you arrive, but still cooked fresh for each guest.
	•	🧁 SSG (Static Site Generation)
Like picking up pastries from a bakery display case — everything was made earlier, and now it’s just served.

⸻

🛠 Then include:
	•	📸 Diagrams of request flow
	•	🗂️ A checklist: “How to choose the right rendering mode for your site”
	•	🤖 Angular-specific twist: How Angular Universal fits into the picture
