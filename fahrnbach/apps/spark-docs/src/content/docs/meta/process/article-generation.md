So, 
I'm super excited to make this with you, and I've prepared a bit of a meta-process for us to work on filling in each post in the SparkDocs Catalogue


Notes for GPT: 
below, within the >>><<< markers is a formated template for you to follow.
Please replace all of the instructions within [[[]]] with a full generated article in .md format
Please generate a title, a description, and tags for the frontmatter. 
Be sure to only use " double parenthesis to wrap each frontmatter item.

Please generate a descriptive overview

Please generate a concise, but easy to understand article that should serve as the starting place 
/ virtual living blueprint for bringing each idea to life 

The article should be created from your memory and any additional context given, 
And be sure to fully read the previous document if given if the iteration count is > 0.
I will share with you the sidebar tree / pertinent files for each article to be generated.
Please ALWAYS share the files as .md format, and paste them into a codeblock

Follow the format below. 
>>>
---
title: "insert title here"
description: "insert description here"
tags: [insert, tags, here]
