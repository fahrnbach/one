Ok that looks really good! Thanks for helping me to make this a reality!
It’s going to be really cool!

Next, I have 2 more questions. Then we can scaffold up the pre-prototype portfolio v2 (What would be a better way to call this)

Assistant:

You’re all set! Here are the markdown files for the blog versions you requested…
Let me know when you’re ready to kick off Phase 1 or if you want diagrams, visual dashboards, or file scaffolding scripts next.

One is:
What about bun?

if sesame were to evolve into a full standalone app where users sign up and create their own micro-site that THEIR friends could visit, it would be taking way too many hits to make sense as a serverless worker. Cloudflare pages also wouldn’t be a good fit here though, because we’d likely be doing more than 500 builds/ month.

We could definitely do incremental SSG and update our cdn with the newly created/updated sites, but that introduces an important line of questioning:

What is the best way to do this? I’d imagine that keeping the sites would have numerous advantages - from seo to caching to speed.

I’m sure we could find a way to incrementally BUILD each microsite as changes were made, but what is the best way to update the actual files that are being served?

Is there a way to do this without rebuilding the whole list of generated html pages every time someone makes a change?
Would we use a database filled with html files? How does that work?

Assistant:

Great question — yes, you’re describing a very real architectural tradeoff between full rebuilds vs. partial (incremental) builds with persistent CDN storage.

If you’re using something like Bun (or Node), you can:
	•	Use the server to generate individual HTML files when users update content.
	•	Store each HTML file in R2/S3 under a structured path (like /users/slug/index.html).
	•	Maintain a metadata DB (e.g., KV or SQLite) to track the latest build version or timestamp.
	•	Use Cloudflare Workers or another CDN edge router to fetch and serve the HTML directly.

✅ This allows you to scale massively and update individual pages without rebuilding the entire site.

User:

Ok, so there wouldn’t be an easier way to update each file in r2 or s3?

I guess what I’m really asking is - is there a way to update each file and serve them without a ‘server’ or would we be better off to just have a server?

Also, in the trade-offs chart you have a row for :Can be streamed

Can you explain that a bit more?

Assistant:

Updating files in R2/S3 is easy if you have the right hooks: a backend (or Worker) that watches for changes and updates that file only.

But to trigger that update based on user behavior (e.g., saving a profile), you’ll need:
	•	a backend API route (to handle the event),
	•	OR a Worker that listens and re-generates HTML based on the update.

Streaming means: instead of generating the whole HTML file and sending it at once, you can start sending parts of the page while the rest is still generating (e.g., headers, then body, then footer).
It’s useful for:
	•	Faster perceived load time
	•	Very large templates
But you lose static cacheability unless you cache the streamed result yourself.

User:

Ok, so In practice, we would need several different server routes right?

api/build/${slug} - triggers build step for that slug
api/update/${slug} - updates the file
	•	I’m thinking we may want to run some kind of message queue step too? In case a user decides to update their profile 50 times a minute, we’d only push updates every 5 minutes. (Or maybe we could just debounce them and show a message “max updates/hr reached Try again later…”)

Also, would it make sense to batch the updates - All the updates done every 5 minutes go all at once - would there be any benefit to doing this?

api/invalidate/${slug} - invalidates the old file?

How exactly would the invalidation logic happen?

Assistant:

You’ve got it! This is exactly how many modern JAMstack platforms operate.

✅ Yes to batching — it reduces redundant builds and PUT requests.

Invalidation Options:
	1.	Explicit purge (Cloudflare API): You call the API with the URL to purge.
	2.	Soft cache-busting: Use versioned URLs or headers.

Example:
```
await BUCKET.put(`username/index.v=1234.html`, html)
return Response.redirect(`/${slug}/index.html?v=1234`)
```

 You can also:
	•	Store latestVersion in a DB or KV
	•	Use Workers to route to the latest HTML

User:

Also, I’m interested in this approach too.
💡 Bonus: Hybrid Model (Best of Both)

Use Bun (or Node) to:
• Generate static HTML to disk or R2
• Store a hash or timestamp in a DB
• Use a CDN-aware worker/router to serve latest HTML from file store

Then:
• If user updates content → re-run their build(slug)
• CDN invalidates that page only
• ✅ Boom: Fast, SEO-ready, and infinite scale

Assistant:

Yes — this hybrid model is your best bet for combining scale + SEO + performance.

Why it works:
	•	Bun or Node acts as your builder (can be called on-demand or on a cron)
	•	R2 stores versioned HTML files
	•	Your Worker maps slugs → versioned files

Bonus: You don’t need to invalidate via Cloudflare API if you use versioned URLs like:
sesame.fahrnbach.one/jacob?v=1234

Search engines may see new URLs as new content — you can use canonical tags or structured data to help them group it.

Only if:
• You’re dealing with many users editing simultaneously
• You’re optimizing cost and compute cycles

Ok, so this is actually where my mind was at. Would we be able to have the bun server process like 15 http calls at the same time?…

Would this actually save on cost in reality?

(Maybe for a FAANG level company yeah but for an app with 10 or 100 thousand users?)

Invalidation:
I’m thinking we would be much better off to do v=timestamp…

Assistant:

Yes — a single Bun process can handle many parallel builds (multi-core helps).

Batching helps:
	•	Lower IOPS (disk/network)
	•	De-dupe requests (drop redundant edits)

For 1K–100K users:
	•	R2 costs = per PUT & per GB stored
	•	Build compute costs = how long Bun takes to compile HTML
	•	Workers = priced by request & CPU time

✅ Your debounce + batch model is great.
✅ Use v=timestamp in a redirect response or query param.
Google will update once it re-crawls — set canonical tags to point to slug-only URL if needed.

User:

Use a hash-based file path in R2:
Ok, so both of these methods would increase PUTS to R2, AND depend on calling the latest version up from a database right?

Also, what will this do for seo? Will google just retain links/previews for whatever version they had last crawled?…

Just trying to think about how all of these pieces will need to evolve as the app scales.

Assistant:

Yep — both methods would increase PUTs but give you version tracking + rollback potential.

For SEO:
	•	You can redirect /${slug} to /slug/index.v=1234.html
	•	OR serve /slug and have Workers resolve latest HTML from DB

Google will index whatever it’s linked to. To guide it:
	•	Use canonical tags
	•	Use sitemap updates

✅ Edge functions keep latency low (they’re close to the bucket)
✅ Scaling to a Go/K8s service later is viable, but CDN-first keeps costs and complexity low at this stage.

I can mock up a diagram of the full flow (User → Worker → R2 + DB → Response)
Let’s do this

Assistant:

🎉 Let’s go!
Here’s your basic flow for a hybrid SSG setup with CDN-aware edge logic:
	1.	User submits update (via frontend UI)
	2.	Worker receives update, writes DB & triggers Bun build
	3.	Bun generates HTML and uploads to R2
	4.	Worker serves latest file (based on DB version or query param)

Optional:
	•	Queue jobs to reduce frequency of build
	•	Invalidate cache (via versioned filenames or explicit purge)

Ok, awesome. If you could help me build a detailed action plan including the highlights of what we’ve talked about in the past several messages, that would be awesome.

Make it as detailed as possible, and try to make it make sense for a full-stack dev familiar with terminology , but not the specifics of our project.

Assistant:

Absolutely! I’ll structure the plan into phases with technical goals, architecture, routes, and deployment strategies.

It will include:
	•	Static generation logic
	•	Worker/CDN strategy
	•	R2 storage model
	•	Debounce + batching plan
	•	Routes & APIs

I’ll export it to markdown too.
