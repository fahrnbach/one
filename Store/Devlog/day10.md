## 🚀 Day 10: Clear(ing) for Launch!

> 🟣 Retrospective: “Today felt like prepping a rocket for orbit — wiring systems, patching bugs, and aligning engines for liftoff.”

**Highlights:**
- Successfully scaffolded a brand new **Starlight-powered Astro site** at `docs.fahrnbach.one`
- Configured sidebar routing and cleaned up default boilerplate
- Implemented and tested support for `_category_.json` and `sidebar.mjs` routing strategies
- Added new sections: `/meta`, `/tips`, `/troubleshooting`, and `/logs`
- Created and styled a fully functioning **Observations Log** to capture day-to-day quirks and bugs
- Identified and documented a number of key **monorepo + Astro quirks**
- Added a global tips file and populated it with DX patterns (e.g., YAML quote rules, casing behavior)
- Integrated **Open Graph image handling** support (planned for `meta-worker`)
- Researched frontmatter linting and started planning a `lint-frontmatter` route/tool
- Created a vibrant `metaSidebar` using emoji-coded sections and nested groups
- Discovered that casing inconsistencies in `src/content/docs/` folders (like `futureDX` vs `futuredx`) can silently break routing

**Summary:**
Today we made huge progress transforming a plain Astro starter into a fully featured documentation app. After choosing Starlight for its clean DX and compatibility with content collections, we scaffolded the docs site and immediately dove into customizing the layout and sidebar logic. We learned that `sidebar.mjs` is essential for top-level structure and that `_category_.json` only works at the subfolder level unless `sidebar.mjs` is disabled.

We added dedicated sections for meta thoughts, tooling tips, logs, and future DX ideas — all organized with emoji-coded clarity. Special attention was given to quirks with folder naming, frontmatter formatting, and how Astro handles `getStaticPaths()` errors. We now have a foundation for long-term documentation of infrastructure, patterns, and pain points.

**Intent:**
Build a scalable, searchable, and themed documentation site to house project architecture, internal logic, future features, DX improvements, and onboarding help.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Astro’s routing system is **sensitive to casing** — lowercase folders only.
- You **must restart** the dev server after updating `sidebar.mjs` for changes to apply.
- Use `sidebar.mjs` for root-level grouping and `_category_.json` for subfolder order/naming.
- Frontmatter must use **double quotes** to support apostrophes and avoid YAML errors.

**Future Improvements:**
- Add Mermaid-based architecture diagrams for visual documentation
- Build out the **meta worker** for dynamic Open Graph image generation
- Consider a “Quick Fixes” section that ties into the Observations Log
- Add changelogs and link Devlog entries as a living history of the project
- Explore frontmatter linting rules and add a `lint-frontmatter.mjs` utility

> 🧠 Boss Battle Report: Today we fought two mid-tier bosses — **Monorepo Gremlins** and **Astro’s Sidebar Dragon**. Both were defeated… for now.
