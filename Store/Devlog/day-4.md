## 🛠️ Day -4: Building the Backend
```
🟡 **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Set up Express backend with routes for: `/admin-login`, `/dashboard`, `/api/admin/sessions`, `/stats`, `/clear`
- Added simple token validation using `.env` values.
- Integrated Redis for storing Genie session data.

**Summary:**
Core services began to take shape as the admin API framework went live. Redis was introduced to handle ephemeral session logic, marking a shift toward scalable, persistent features. This day defined the backend’s first true skeleton — secure, modular, and ready to expand.

**Intent:**
Lay down the backend foundation for session handling, access control, and future metrics collection. This was the starting point for making the portfolio truly interactive — with data moving between user, assistant, and administrator in a secure, maintainable flow.
