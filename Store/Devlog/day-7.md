## ðŸ§­ Day -7: Project Kickoff & Vision
```
ðŸŸ¡ **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Initiated the full-stack portfolio + assistant project.
- Brainstormed Genie assistant as a whimsical front-end demo + useful backend tool.
- Outlined future potential: multi-purpose, reusable chat assistant (possible NPM package).
- Discussed separation of concerns: admin panel for stats/control, Genie for UX demo.

**Summary:**
This day marked the conceptual birth of the portfolio and assistant ecosystem. It was about sketching out the missionâ€”setting up the vision for an assistant thatâ€™s both practical and playful, while beginning to mentally scaffold the infrastructure and experience layers that would support the broader portfolio platform.

**Intent**
This groundwork should serve as the cornerstone for a portfolio that not only showcases skills, but also invites curiosity and interaction.
