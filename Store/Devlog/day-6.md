## 🏗️ Day -6: Architecture & DNS Setup
```
🟡 **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Chose subdomain architecture: `admin.fahrnbach.one`, `api.fahrnbach.one`, `genie.fahrnbach.one`.
- Configured Cloudflare DNS.
- Troubleshot DKIM, SPF, and DMARC settings for domain-linked email.

**Summary:**
This day was all about setting the digital ground rules. It included designing a scalable subdomain strategy and securing communication channels. These decisions laid the groundwork for the separation of services and the trustworthiness of automated system emails and verifications.

**Intent**
Establish a future-proof network topology that supports modular growth and strong authentication practices from day one. The subdomains reflect architectural thinking that mirrors microservice architecture.
