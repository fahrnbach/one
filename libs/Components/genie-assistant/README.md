## 🔍 Why We Copy index.html for Preview

When building this project as a library using Vite, the `build` step does **not** include the demo HTML file by default. This is intentional — Vite assumes you're publishing a JS library, not a website.

However, to preview the assistant *as it would look in production*, we copy the `demo/index.html` file into the `dist/` folder after build using this command:

```bash
shx cp demo/index.html dist/index.html'

## 🎯 Pro tip: vite preview is like a mini production server — it shows you exactly what your site will look like after deploy.
