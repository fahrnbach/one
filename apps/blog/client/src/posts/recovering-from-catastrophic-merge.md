# 🧨 Recovering from a Catastrophic Merge: Lessons Learned the Hard Way

A few days ago, I accidentally wiped out several days of uncommitted work during a misguided `git merge` operation. What followed was hours of panic, reflection, recovery—and now, documentation.

This post is part cautionary tale, part devlog, and part therapy. Let’s break it down.

## 🧠 The Setup

I was in the process of consolidating multiple standalone projects into a single monorepo. It was a restructuring sprint—cleaning, renaming, planning how each module would fit into the broader architecture.

Now, I am usually REALLY good at committing. I will commit after changing 2-30 lines of code! Basically any time I've finished working in one file or function I'll Commit with a little message. More is MORE. 

Not this time....
Because I wasn’t adding many new features, and only templating boilerplate - I’d fallen into a bad habit: **not making commits**.

Just before merging in my blog repo, I thought, *“I’ll clean this up right after I get the folders sorted.”*  
I used `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories`... and watched two full days of work vanish.

## 💥 The Disaster

Suddenly, dozens of files—admin dashboards, gateway scripts, design tweaks—were gone.

Worse, because I hadn’t committed them, they weren’t in the reflog, weren’t in `stash`, and weren’t part of either branch’s Git history.

I tried everything:
- `git reset --hard HEAD`
- `git reflog`
- `git revert`
- `git restore`

No luck.

## 🧙‍♂️ The Hero: VS Code

Out of desperation, I opened the **Command Palette** in VS Code and typed:

> `Local History: Find Entry to Restore`

I didn’t expect anything...  
But to my amazement, there they were: dozens of files, each with snapshots from just a few hours before.

**I restored nearly everything.**

## 📚 Lessons Learned

This was a painful, but powerful lesson. Here’s what I’m doing differently now:

1. ✅ **Commit Frequently**  
Even if the code isn’t "done." A commit is a safety net.

2. ✅ **Branch Before Merging Unrelated Histories**  
Use `git switch -c` to make a temporary branch when you're doing risky merges.

3. ✅ **Backup Locally Before Big Operations**  
If you’re restructuring folders or merging large repos, zip and backup your working directory first.

## 🎁 Bonus: Git Pro Tips I Picked Up

- `git rm --cached folder/` is your friend for removing nested repos
- `git subtree split` lets you push folders to separate repos
- `VS Code Local History` is a hidden gem (but not a substitute for Git)

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

This almost broke momentum—but in the end, I recovered everything important, gained new wisdom, and strengthened my process.

I hope this helps someone avoid the same trap.

Stay sharp. Make backups. Commit often.
