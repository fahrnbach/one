## Overview

The login page is the access gateway to the Admin Dashboard. This interface must strike a balance between **security**, **usability**, and **extensibility**, serving as a foundation for future enhancements like federated authentication and decentralized identity verification.

<Aside type="note">This page will evolve as admin tooling and access layers become more sophisticated.</Aside>

## Core Goals

- 🔐 Provide secure, session-aware login for dashboard admins
- 🪪 Prepare groundwork for OAuth and future identity integrations
- ⚙️ Modular backend compatibility for different auth strategies

## Modular Integration

This authentication layer is not just for the admin dashboard — it's being engineered as a **modular, drop-in component** for any future-facing applications within the *fahrnbach.one* ecosystem.

- 📦 Shared auth logic across admin, CMS, pitch apps, store, and more
- 🔁 Unified token/session formats across services
- 🔌 Configurable middleware hooks for custom permissions, throttling, logging

<Aside type="tip">
Think of this as your plug-and-play identity provider for internal and external tools. One login module to rule them all — secure, scalable, and portable.
</Aside>

## Current Implementation

The current login interface is simple and password-protected, relying on cookie/session-based authentication to guard access to admin routes. The backend validates credentials and issues signed tokens for protected dashboard interactions.

## Planned Upgrades

### Federated Login

We plan to introduce OAuth integrations for trusted providers like:

- Google Workspace
- GitHub (for developers)
- Auth0 / Clerk / Supabase Auth (for broader extensibility)

This would allow granular role mapping and SSO-style workflows.

### Crypto Passport (Future Vision)

In the longer term, this system may support **cryptographic login**:

- Wallet-based signatures (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Verifiable Credentials / DIDs
- "Zero-knowledge" attestations for permissioned access

<Aside type="tip">
Future integration with Ethereum-compatible identity layers could enable passwordless access for ecosystem participants — tying permissions directly to on-chain identity.
</Aside>

## UX Notes

- Autofocus and keyboard accessibility should be prioritized
- Login errors should never reveal which part of the credential was incorrect
- Rate-limiting and lockout strategy should be clearly defined on the backend
