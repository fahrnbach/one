## Overview

This document defines the authentication module intended to serve as a reusable, drop-in system across all full-scale applications within the fahrnbach.one ecosystem. The module will handle login flows, session persistence, and eventual federated identity integrations using modern, secure standards.

The long-term goal is to establish a single source of truth for authentication logic, enabling consistent access control, pluggable UI components, and streamlined onboarding across tools like the Admin Dashboard, Genie interface, Sesame pitch pages, and beyond.

<Aside type="tip">
This module acts as the gateway to all protected infrastructure and admin capabilities. Investing in a solid auth layer is essential for both security and developer ergonomics.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Built to be imported and reused across multiple frontend frameworks.
- **Session Handling**: Support for cookies, tokens, and backend-aware session stores (e.g., Redis).
- **Login UI Components**: Reusable buttons, fields, and loading states across apps.
- **Future-Proofing**:
  - OAuth login with GitHub, Google, LinkedIn
  - Crypto-based login with Ethereum wallets or Passport ID
  - Decentralized Identity standards (DID, VC)

## Architecture

- **Core Interface**: A shared `auth.ts` module will expose utility functions (`loginUser()`, `getSession()`, `isAdmin()`).
- **Adapter Pattern**: Swappable storage backends and session stores (in-memory, Redis, JWT).
- **Frontend-Agnostic**: Auth logic kept separate from UI; compatible with Angular, Astro, plain JS, etc.

## Next Steps

1. Implement `auth.ts` core utilities
2. Create Redis-backed session prototype
3. Build minimal UI login form for Admin Dashboard
4. Set up environment-driven credential storage (e.g., via `.env` or secrets manager)
5. Add login logging + rate limiting

## Future Planning

- Add federated OAuth login for developers and invited collaborators
- Explore Ethereum-based Passport login for open ecosystem tools
- Add permission roles (viewer, admin, editor) for better access control

<Aside type="caution">
Do not hardcode secrets or rely on browser storage for long-lived tokens. Always validate on the backend.
