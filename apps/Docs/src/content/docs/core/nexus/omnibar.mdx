# 🔍 Omnibar

The **Omnibar** is the augmented intelligence layer that redefines what it means to search and navigate within the *fahrnbach.one* ecosystem. More than just a search bar, it's a **genie-powered, magic-fused interface** capable of searching files, traversing federated sub-sites, and answering natural language queries in real-time.

<Aside type="note">
  This system is built to evolve. As more subdomains and SparkDocs come online, the Omnibar will intelligently weave them into a single fluid interface.

## Design Philosophy

- 🌐 **One Bar to Rule Them All** — Replaces traditional navbars and clunky sidebars with a unified point of interaction.
- 📱 **Mobile First** — On small screens, the Omnibar transforms into a floating “MiniOmni” for quick access without relying on a hamburger menu.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Insight** — Enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic context awareness, and whisper-style intent parsing.
- 🧩 **Composable UI** — The Omnibar can display inline results, quick actions, fuzzy search previews, or deep link callouts.

## Features

- 🔮 Genie-powered riddle entry for unlocking premium tools or assistant access
- 🔍 Local file search with fuzzy matching
- 🛰 Federated search across blog, docs, components, snippets, and more
- 🗣 Natural language querying (powered by GenIA backend)
- 🎯 Smart commands (e.g. `/jump blog`, `/find AuthComponent`, `/ask What is SparkDocs?`)
- 🧭 Persistent context tracking for task continuity

## Access & Invites

While many of the Omnibar's core features are available to all users, access to its most powerful AI capabilities — such as semantic understanding, natural language response generation, and advanced retrieval — will require authentication.

To make the experience feel special and curated, these advanced features can also be unlocked via a limited **invite system**:

- 🎟 **Invites may be shared** via press kits, recruiter outreach, or embedded directly into email footers and digital resumes.
- 🧞‍♂️ **Unlock codes** may be granted after solving a riddle or by completing a special guided walkthrough.
- 🔐 **Authenticated users** gain access to premium features, persistent memory, and deeper site-wide insights.

This system aims to balance openness with thoughtful onboarding, offering high-trust users a deeper and more personalized experience with the Fahrnbach ecosystem.

## Future Vision

As the Fahrnbach network grows, the Omnibar will act as the **nervous system** of the platform — weaving content, tools, and interaction together with memory, intent, and flow.

<Aside type="tip">
  Want to try building something like this? Start with a fuzzy search module, then layer in semantic search using embeddings. Genie is just the beginning.
