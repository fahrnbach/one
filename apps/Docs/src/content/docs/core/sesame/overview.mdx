# 🌱 Sesame Overview

Sesamé is a modular, self-hostable microsite builder and outreach platform designed to help individuals showcase their work, personalize their pitch, and build meaningful connections — one company at a time.

What started as a static site generator (SSG) for job search outreach has grown into a vision for a new kind of personal storytelling platform — one that combines the power of intentional design, AI augmentation, and interactive outreach tools.

<Aside type="note">
  This overview will evolve alongside the Sesame platform. As v2 rolls out, new capabilities will be documented here.
</Aside>

## Current Usage

At its core, the Sesame v1 experience serves as a powerful tool for job seekers and creators to:

- 🎯 **Target specific companies** with dedicated microsites
- 📝 **Customize written pitches** and tailored video intros for each company
- 🗂️ **Drive engagement** through a shared JSON manifest that maps all custom pages
- 🧭 **Guide viewers** to resume links, portfolio content, and scheduling tools

Pages are hosted at URLs like `sesame.fahrnbach.one/company-name`, and each page can include Open Graph metadata for rich social previews, a personalized greeting, and even light theming.

## Planned Features for v2

The vision for Sesame v2 is much more ambitious. It will evolve from a static tool into a smart, assistant-augmented web app. Planned features include:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **“Share with a colleague” button** for virality within orgs
- 🔗 **Smart URL personalization**, dynamically rendering content based on query params (e.g., `?to=Sarah`)
- 🧠 **AI-enhanced copy suggestions**, pitch generation, and resume tuning
- 🔓 **Progressively unlockable tools** depending on use history and role (e.g., creator, recruiter)
- 🛠️ **Dashboard interface** for editing and managing pitches, videos, and themes
- 🧳 **Export options** for PDFs, media kits, and public-facing landing pages

## What It Will Become

Ultimately, Sesame is meant to be much more than a personal outreach tool — it is the **first node in a network of human-centered utilities** that make storytelling, hiring, and collaboration simpler and more magical.

Think of it as the **microsite builder of the future**:

- 🎥 For creators — a personal trailer and living pitch deck
- 💼 For recruiters — a clear, organized signal among noise
- 🌍 For communities — a platform to organize, inspire, and launch

With time, Sesame may evolve into a full ecosystem that includes integrations with:

- 💌 Email & calendaring tools
- 🌐 Custom domains and DNS helpers
- 🧱 Resume + Portfolio builders
- 🔍 Searchable company directories
- 🧩 Embeddable widgets & analytics
- 🪄 Onboarding flows for new hires or collaborators

<Aside type="tip">
  The name "Sesame" is a nod to the magic phrase — "Open Sesame" — representing permission, access, and potential. What could be more fitting?
</Aside>

## Intent

To build a modular, extensible platform that helps individuals cut through the noise and show up with clarity, personality, and purpose — one company, one page, one connection at a time.
