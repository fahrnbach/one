## Overview

The **Pitch Pages** are a core feature of [sesame.fahrnbach.one](https://sesame.fahrnbach.one) — personalized microsites designed to deliver targeted outreach to companies, recruiters, or collaborators.

Each pitch page is accessible via a unique slug:
```
sesame.fahrnbach.one/company-name
```

These are generated dynamically using a shared `manifest.json` file that stores:
- 📝 A personalized written pitch
- 🎥 A link to a custom video introduction
- 🔗 Key links: Calendly, GitHub, Resume (slug-matched), Blog, Portfolio

<Aside type="note">
The resume is dynamically matched to the slug — e.g., `sesame.fahrnbach.one/openai` serves `resume.fahrnbach.one/openai.pdf`.

To create a seamless bridge between interest and action — making it easy for employers to engage, book, and hire, with minimal friction and maximum delight.
