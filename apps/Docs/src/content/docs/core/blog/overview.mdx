## Overview

Welcome to the central hub of the **fahrnbach.one** blog system ‚Äî a fully custom, Angular-powered frontend that combines structured content with powerful visual tools. This isn't your average blog ‚Äî it's a modular publishing platform with WYSIWYG authoring, programmable components, and API-driven design.

<Aside type="tip">This system is designed with both maintainers and readers in mind, aiming to create a seamless balance between developer experience and content creativity.</Aside>

## Architecture Highlights

- **Frontend**: Built using Angular, with a structured layout and reusable components.
- **CMS**: Fully integrated visual editor (WYSIWYG) with support for rich Markdown + frontmatter.
- **API**: GraphQL-based content layer (via Yoga) that feeds posts, metadata, and structured queries.
- **Component Federation**: Blog widgets and design components can be dropped into other sites.
- **Reciprocation Engine**: Designed to support syndicated content, with federated posting on the roadmap.

## Key Features
