import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

The `HotPostsComponent` is a plug-and-play Angular module designed to display the most interacted-with blog posts with 'near' (24hr) real-time updates. It‚Äôs ideal for surfacing currently popular content to increase engagement and time-on-site.

<Aside type="tip">This component is especially useful on landing pages or as a sidebar insert to help users discover trending material they might otherwise miss.</Aside>

## üß† How It Works

- Fetches from the `/api/hot` endpoint.
- Ranks posts by a combination of:
  - Page views
  - Time spent on page
  - Engagement (click-throughs, reactions)
- Includes a manual override/curation mechanism (via future AI worker or manual admin dashboard).
- Easily styled and embeddable into any Angular page or layout.

## üß© Integration

```ts
// app.module.ts
import { HotPostsComponent } from './components/hot-posts/hot-posts.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [HotPostsComponent],
  exports: [HotPostsComponent]
})
export class BlogComponentsModule {}
```

```html
<!-- Inside any template -->
<hot-posts></hot-posts>
```

## üö¶ Curation Pipeline (Planned)

The hot feed will be curated through a combination of:
	‚Ä¢	Realtime stats from the analytics layer
	‚Ä¢	An AI worker process that flags emergent trends
	‚Ä¢	Manual curation by admins (fallback or override)

<Aside type="tip">We plan to make the AI-assisted curation logic modular, so it can be reused for tags like ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù or ‚Äútrending in category.‚Äù</Aside>

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Ideas

	‚Ä¢	Add a filter by tag or category.
	‚Ä¢	Option to show hot posts per author or series.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-site integration (e.g. show blog posts on nexus).
