## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Content Management System (CMS) used for managing blog posts, site content, and configuration within our platform.

<Aside type="note">The CMS has direct integration with the GraphQL API and connects to our D1-backed post database. This system is built for both flexibility and power, and is evolving quickly!</Aside>

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **WYSIWYG Editor** ‚Äì Write posts using a Markdown editor enhanced with custom components.
- **Frontmatter Validation** ‚Äì All posts follow a strict schema (Zod + SQL) to ensure consistency.
- **Preview Before Publish** ‚Äì See exactly what your post will look like with a live preview.
- **Autosave + Drafts** ‚Äì Edit safely with automatic saving and version tracking.
- **Custom Tags/Categories** ‚Äì Add or reuse tags and categories on the fly.
- **Series Support** ‚Äì Group posts into serialized series with part numbers and navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It

1. **Log in** at `/admin/login` to access the dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Posts**.
3. Click **Create New** or select an existing post to edit.
4. Fill in required fields: title, slug, excerpt, etc.
5. Add Markdown content and drag/drop media as needed.
6. Assign tags, categories, and visibility settings.
7. Click **Save Draft** or **Publish** to finalize your work.

<Aside type="tip">You can also use the `/api/graphql` endpoint to programmatically create, update, or fetch posts if needed. See the [API Schema Guide](/api/schema) for more info.</Aside>

## üìã Field Reference

Each post includes:
- `title`, `slug`, `description`, `excerpt`
- `tags`, `categories`, `author`
- `readingTime`, `cover`, `images`
- `status`, `published`, `draft`, `scheduled`
- Optional series metadata and access flags

<Aside type="caution">Always make sure slugs are unique and URLs are human-readable. Slug collisions can break routes or confuse readers!</Aside>

## üîÆ What's Coming Next?

- Role-based permissions for editors and contributors
- Inline image editor for uploads to R2
- Integrated AI assistant for content suggestions
- Scheduled publishing and version history
