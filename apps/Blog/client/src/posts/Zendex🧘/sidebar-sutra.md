# Zendex #2: The Sidebar Sutra

## ðŸ§˜ Overview
We once believed the sidebar should simply work. But nothing in life â€” or Starlight â€” is that simple.

## Mysteries of the Sidebar
From `setupSidebar.mjs` to folder-driven magic, this post walks through the trials of getting your nav hierarchy in order.

## Splitting the Scroll
We discovered peace by modularizing the sidebar: `coreSidebar`, `outreachSidebar`, `metaSidebar`, etc.

## Design as Documentation
Each layer of navigation mirrors a thought structure. Clarifying your sidebar clarifies your intent.

## Takeaways
- Sidebar = Story structure
- Use collapsible sections with care
- Modular sidebars increase maintainability and mental calm
```
