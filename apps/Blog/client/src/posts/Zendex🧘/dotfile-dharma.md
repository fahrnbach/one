# Zendex #3: Dotfile Dharma

## ðŸ§˜ Overview
Behind every great dev lies a dotfile. These invisible scripts hold the keys to comfort, control, and joy.

## Whatâ€™s in a Dot?
Why your terminal feels like home â€” and how your aliases, exports, and keybindings reflect your inner world.

## The Zsh of It All
Custom prompt themes, `nvm` bootstrapping, and color-coded contexts. A living `.zshrc` is like bonsai: cultivated and calm.

## Sharing Your Setup
Dotfiles are a form of self-expression. Share them, backup often, and document as a service to your future self.

## Takeaways
- Treat your shell config like sacred scrolls
- Bootstrap your whole environment for faster onboarding
- Productivity is peace when dotfiles flow
