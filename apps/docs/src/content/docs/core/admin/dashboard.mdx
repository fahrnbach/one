## Overview

The **Admin Dashboard** is a powerful, purpose-built interface for overseeing the operational state of all services within the *fahrnbach.one* ecosystem. It acts as both a **real-time monitor** and a **control panel**, designed with clarity, control, and responsiveness in mind.

Whether you‚Äôre checking if a microservice is healthy, reviewing request metrics, or restarting a backend API ‚Äî this dashboard is your launchpad. It‚Äôs not just functional, it‚Äôs intuitive ‚Äî with widgets and graphs designed to surface meaningful insights at a glance.

Admins should feel empowered, not overwhelmed. The dashboard provides a visual pulse of the system, helping us remain agile, informed, and confident under pressure.

<Aside type="note">This system will evolve in sync with our infrastructure. Expect versioned improvements as we scale horizontally.</Aside>


This document outlines the initial goals and structure of the admin interface. It will evolve alongside backend infrastructure and user feedback. Keep structure consistent.

## üîç Core Features

- **System Health Overview**:
  - Color-coded indicators for services (green/yellow/red).
  - Aggregated metrics like response times, error rates, and CPU/memory usage.

- **Uptime & Downtime Logs**:
  - Graphical history using time-based plots (e.g. area or line charts).
  - Drill-downs for individual services.

- **Manual Controls**:
  - Restart buttons with debounce + confirmation for microservices or containers.
  - Triggered webhooks or infrastructure calls (with auth lock).

- **Logs & Events Feed**:
  - Stream tail for logs (maybe per-service).
  - Filterable by severity.

- **Notifications Panel**:
  - Highlight errors, thresholds exceeded, or downtime alerts.

- **Widgets**:
  - Pluggable components for specialized graphs (e.g. user traffic, Redis cache size).
  - Future-proofed: support drag/reorder or minimize.

## üß† Design Principles

- **Readable**: High contrast, clearly labeled, accessible layout.
- **Modular**: Widget-based architecture, allowing for app-specific monitors.
- **Real-Time-ish**: Leverage polling or websocket updates without overwhelming the server.
- **Permission-Gated**: Ensure only authorized users can perform restarts or write actions.

---

## üìê Tech & Data

- **UI**: Likely Angular (or Svelte/React), powered by a small SSR-compatible backend.
- **Data Feeds**: Pulled from APIs like `/status`, `/metrics`, or custom WebSocket events.
- **Styling**: Shared design tokens with the broader design system (e.g., buttons, cards).
- **Auth**: Shared login system with the sesame + blog admin panel.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Ideas

- Theme-aware day/night modes
- Full historical metrics export
- Customizable widget layouts (user preference persistence)
- AI Assistant: Genie could optionally help interpret anomalies or predict downtime trends

<Aside type="caution">This dashboard does **not** serve as a security audit tool. That will be handled separately via specialized interfaces.</Aside>
