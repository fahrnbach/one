import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

This page documents the **reusable Angular components** featured in our dynamic, searchable component viewer.

The library is designed for **maximum modularity** and is intended to evolve alongside our core design system and CMS tooling.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Dynamically displays categorized Angular components
- Pulls from a structured file tree with standardized metadata
- Powers a fuzzy-search interface to browse, preview, and explore available modules

<Aside type="note">All components include frontmatter that defines their category, tags, complexity level, and intended usage scope.</Aside>

---

## 🧱 Component Metadata Structure

Each component begins with a frontmatter block like so:

```ts
// ./components/card/card.component.ts
/*
---
title: "Card"
category: "UI"
tags: ["layout", "responsive", "themeable"]
level: "beginner"
audience: "frontend"
description: "A flexible content container with optional header and footer slots."
status: "stable"
usedAI: false
---
*/

```
<Aside type="tip">This frontmatter is parsed and used by the library viewer to organize, filter, and annotate components.</Aside>

## 🧪 Component Usage Guidelines

Each module includes:
	•	✅ Example markup with usage context
	•	💡 Notes on design intent
	•	⚙️ Extensibility or slot instructions
