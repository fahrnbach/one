## Overview

The **Store** tab on [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) will serve as the central storefront for prints, apparel, and other creative works from the Fahrnbach universe. Most of the offerings will be **print-on-demand** to begin with, allowing for lightweight fulfillment and iterative releases.

<Aside type="note">
  The store is an evolving space, both technically and artistically ‚Äî expect it to grow as designs, logistics, and partnerships mature.

## Fulfillment Services Considered

We're currently exploring the following platforms:

- **Gelato** ‚Äì Global reach, integration with custom domains, and a robust network of local printers.
- **RoesBay** ‚Äì A boutique option tailored for higher-quality, small-batch art prints with customizable packaging.

These platforms offer the flexibility needed to scale from single prototypes to full seasonal drops, without overcommitting on inventory.

## Intent

To allow the Fahrnbach creative ecosystem to support itself ‚Äî while giving fans and collaborators a tangible piece of the world we're building.

Future plans include:

- üõçÔ∏è NFT or token-gated exclusives
- üì¶ Custom packaging for signed editions
- üé® Community-suggested designs and collaborations
