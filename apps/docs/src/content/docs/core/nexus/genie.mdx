## Overview

Genie is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that started as a creative solution for interacting with a portfolio. It introduced a whimsical gatekeeping mechanic ‚Äî answer a riddle to unlock access ‚Äî and quickly became something more:

- ‚ú® A secure gateway to ask deeper questions
- üóùÔ∏è A personalized, memory-aware assistant
- üß† A backend layer for content discovery across namespaces

---

## Evolution

- **Origin:** Riddle-unlocked chat interface for [fahrnbach.one](https://fahrnbach.one)
- **Phase Two:** Integrated Redis sessions, rate limiting, and lightweight admin logging
- **Phase Three:** Became the primary interface engine for Omnibar and other assistants

---

## Architecture Highlights

- RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over local context chunks
- Redis: Session, state, and usage throttling
- Backend: Node.js API with riddle + ask endpoints
- Frontend: Custom vanilla JS interface with sparkle animations and personality

---

## Intent

To be more than just a chatbot ‚Äî Genie is a testbed for interaction design, narrative onboarding, and AI-powered exploration.
