# 🚀 Home

The **Home** tab of [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) is where the journey begins. It’s a dynamic welcome mat — a cross-dimensional portal that orients users, guests, and future collaborators alike.

At its heart: an embedded interactive **Three.js** universe, a lovingly built homage to the original [fahrnbach.one](https://fahrnbach.one) site.

<Aside type="note">
  This tab is meant to feel alive — shifting, adapting, and expanding as new components are added across the Fahrnbach ecosystem.

## Inspirations

- **Sci-fi terminals** from 90s films and games
- A blend of *feeling* and *function*, like a museum lobby for your projects
- Hover-reactive elements and story-based navigation

## Future Additions

- Intro video + custom audio soundtrack (optional)
- AI-powered greeting messages
