## Future Plans

| Feature | Vision |
|--------|--------|
| **Unified Visual Style** | Gradually build a design language across product lines |
| **Custom Bundles** | Themed product drops for fans, friends, or fundraisers |
| **Physical + Digital Hybrids** | Think prints with QR codes linking to dynamic projects |
| **Limited Editions** | Signed runs or serialized print collections |
| **Collaborative Drops** | Spotlight work from collaborators and artist friends |

<Aside type="tip">
  While we're starting with simple fulfillment options, the long-term plan includes crafting a truly artistic storefront — one that feels like an extension of the design system itself.

## Intent

To build a store that does more than sell — it expresses the ecosystem’s values and aesthetics in tangible, delightful forms.
