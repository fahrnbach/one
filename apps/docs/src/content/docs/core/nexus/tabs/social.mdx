# 🌐 Social

The **Social** tab on [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) serves as the connective tissue between this ecosystem and the broader digital world. It’s a directory of presence, personality, and discovery.

<Aside type="note">
  This section is a living index of social activity — not just contact links, but also a rotating highlight reel of popular posts, community threads, and viral gems.

|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Farcaster**  | [`@fahrnbach`](https://far.quest/~/jfahrnbach) | Active and curious; enjoy posting deep dives and playful dev thoughts |
| **Bluesky**    | `@fahrnbach.one`                             | Quietly experimental — come say hi! |
| **HackerNews** | `fahrnbach`                                  | Reading more than posting (but watching closely 👀) |
| **LinkedIn**   | [`Jacob Fahrnbach`](https://linkedin.com/in/fahrnbach) | Professional updates, blog drops, and connection welcome |
| **X/Twitter**  | 🤷‍♂️ Not really vibing with the echo chamber lately | No, you didn’t miss anything. It’s mutual. |
