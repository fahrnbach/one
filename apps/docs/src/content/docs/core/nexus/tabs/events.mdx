# 📅 Events

The **Events** tab on [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) acts as the dynamic calendar for all future appearances, talks, panels, workshops, hackathons, or conferences that Jacob Fahrnbach is involved in — whether attending, speaking, hosting, or *streaming live from the nexus*.

<Aside type="note">
  This section will grow organically over time. Early on, it may function as a lightweight event log, but will evolve into a richer timeline complete with recaps, recordings, and slide decks.
