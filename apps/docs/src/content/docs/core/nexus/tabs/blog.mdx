## Overview

The **Blog** tab at [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) is a curated, embedded portal into the broader Fahrnbach blog system. While the full content lives at [blog.fahrnbach.one](https://blog.fahrnbach.one), this section provides a window — fast access to hot takes, recent posts, and AI-suggested reads — all without leaving the Nexus experience.

<Aside type="note">
  This tab helps unify the site experience by surfacing intelligent summaries, preview cards, and quick links from the main blog without context switching.

## Key Features

- 📌 **Dynamic Highlights:** AI-curated hot posts and personalized recaps from the main blog.
- 🔍 **Search Preview:** Fuzzy search and tag filters powered by shared schema and metadata.
- 🔗 **Smart Routing:** Seamlessly deep-link into the main blog *or* stay within Nexus via embedded readers or expandable cards.
- 🧠 **Cross-App Federation:** Blog content can link directly into projects, tools, snippets, or pitch pages.

## Architecture Notes

This page is tightly integrated with:

- `blog-api` (GraphQL/Yoga + D1 schema)
- Shared metadata schema for posts
- Hot-posts component module
- Optional AI summarizer (for on-site snippets / TL;DR)

---

## Future Ideas

- Embed full post previews in modal overlays
- Highlight discussions from GitHub or other syndicated sources
- Show a “From the Archives” rotating module
- Feature AI-generated summaries or narrative intros

<Aside type="tip">
  The goal isn’t just to display content — it’s to *contextualize* it. Let users skim, dive, or explore — all from the same interface.
</Aside>

## Intent

To bridge the full blog with the broader Nexus interface — offering a flexible, dynamic, and user-first experience where readers can stay in flow, or leap deep into longform posts when ready.
