## Overview
A modular Angular driven showcase fully dynamic, embeddable module — powered by tagged YAML and or GraphQL.

The showcase is
A living gallery of projects featured at [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one), the **Showcase** tab highlights the best and most innovative creations across the *fahrnbach.one* ecosystem — and beyond.

This is the visual heartbeat of the system — a curated space for top work, inspired design, and clever engineering. It features both original projects **and** an expanding network of creative and technical work from collaborators and friends.

<Aside type="note">
  This section will evolve in public. Think of it as a spotlight reel for progress, creativity, and cleverness — wherever it’s found.
