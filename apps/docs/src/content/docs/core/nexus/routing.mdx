# üó∫Ô∏è Routing

Welcome to the routing universe of **fahrnbach.one** ‚Äî a constellation of purpose-driven subdomains, each serving a unique mission in the ecosystem.

<Aside type="note">
  This document evolves alongside the infrastructure. New routes and sites will be added as they stabilize and deploy.
