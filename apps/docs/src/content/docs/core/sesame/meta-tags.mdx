## Overview

Open Graph meta tags are crucial for making your content shareable and visually appealing across social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Discord. These tags provide a structured way for platforms to generate rich link previews, including titles, descriptions, and images — significantly increasing engagement and clarity when your pages are shared.

## Why It Matters

When someone shares a link to your site, the platform scrapes the Open Graph metadata to populate the preview card. Without it, your content may appear with a blank title, no image, or an irrelevant summary — reducing click-through rates and harming brand presentation.

<Aside type="tip">
Using dynamic Open Graph tags allows you to tailor previews per page, showcasing custom thumbnails, titles, or summaries that make each shared link feel crafted and intentional.

## Example Tags

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="My Amazing Page" />
<meta property="og:description" content="A short summary that invites curiosity." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/preview.jpg" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
```

These tags are typically placed inside the `<head>` of your HTML and can be generated statically or dynamically depending on your framework or SSR approach.
