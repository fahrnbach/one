:::tip Meta Tip: Frontmatter Quoting ðŸ“š
Only use **double quotes** (`"`) for frontmatter values â€” this allows you to use **apostrophes** (`'`) safely in your descriptions and titles without breaking YAML formatting.

:::tip Meta Tip: Restart Required ðŸŒ€
Any time you update `sidebar.mjs`, be sure to **restart the dev server** for changes to take effect.

Astro loads sidebar configuration **once at startup**, so edits wonâ€™t be reflected until a restart.

```bash
CTRL + C      # Stop dev server
pnpm dev      # Restart to reload sidebar

## ðŸ§© Tip: Use Lowercase Folder and File Names for Routes

```
Astro (and Starlight) route matching can be **case-sensitive and inconsistent**, especially when resolving content paths via the sidebar or dynamic imports. For maximum compatibility:

- âœ… Use **lowercase** folder and file names (e.g., `futuredx`, not `futureDX`)
- âœ… Match case exactly in sidebar links (`link: '/meta/futuredx/sidebar-dx'`)
- ðŸš« Avoid camelCase or PascalCase in filenames or folder names for content routes

This helps prevent mysterious 404s and `getStaticPaths()` warnings that occur when the route exists but **isn't matched** due to case mismatch.

_Consistency = clarity._
