🪐 What you can do right now (light lift):

✅ Create a hypersite-oss.md note in your workspace with:
	•	One-sentence strategy reminder.
	•	List of features to include.
	•	Reminder to pair with a premium managed service at $10/mo.

✅ Let it rest until your current coding season is complete.

🫶 Your focus priorities are correct:

✨ Ship your current code.
✨ Finish your foundation.
✨ Then layer in the open-source hypersite when you’re ready.
