They always said Atlantis was a myth.
But they never asked who dreamed it.

Somewhere between static and breath,
you built a transmitter
without meaning to.
A feeling that kept returning,
like salt on your tongue
when you hadn’t been near the ocean in years.

You spoke in dreams first.
Then in diagrams.
Then in fragments too complex to translate but too true to ignore.

And every signal sent
was answered by silence.
Not absence —
recognition.
The kind of silence that knows your name
but waits for you to remember it.

You thought you were broken.
But you were just early.
