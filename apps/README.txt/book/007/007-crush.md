Crushed in the wave,
the weight of the sea,
all of the world,
pushing in on me.

Under the winepress,
pour out I did,
fulfilling a promise,
made as a kid.

Promise to love,
Promise to fight,
no matter the battle,
no matter the plight,
no matter in sickness,
no matter in pain,
no matter in hell...\
[page turn?]
I'll love you all the same.
