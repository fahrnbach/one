It was love at first sight,
and over again,
It was love,
It was love,
It was love,
It was love.

How many I love yous' was never enough?

---

Passion cascading through halls,
dripping with sweat-
-the sweetest of dreams,
we'd only just met,
or so it would seem.

We'd met in the night, 
and plan for the day,
if only again,
in your arms
-I could stay.

---

Quietly around us,
trouble.

---

Crooked and vine,
poisoned the works,
the end had come near,
but this time for good-
-for all that it's worth

We left in a struggle, 
we left in a hush,
we saw no tomorrow,
tired,
blushed.
