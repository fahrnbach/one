This wasn't the kind of love you hear about from songs.
It wasn't the kind you read about in fairytales.
Maybe not the kind of love that you think of when you say you do.


No, THIS was the kind of love that was big enough for the whole world.
This was the kind of love that was brave enough to let everyone in.
This was the kind of love that is so big that you can barely even give it a name.
The kind of love that they are afraid of,
Because-
-This was the kind of love that changes everything-
not in a metaphorical way,
but in a transformative,
almost too big to be imagined,
all encompassing,
all surrounding,
deep in your bones,
deep within the structure of the universe,
no matter where you go it will always be there kind of way.
Not love as a force for good,
But love as the very fabric of reality.
Real, and powerful-
- like the torrent of the great colorado
coursing through the sedimentary planes of Arizona,
unceasingly coursing-
-shaking the very foundation of the world,
until the unmovable basin would finally yield,
The Grand Canyon.
The kind of love that is both terrifying,
and reassuring,
the kind of love that cannot even be fought,
because it exists beneath it all,
a love that always wins
not powerful...
Power

The kind that some holy books have tried to teach,
the kind that has been carefully handed down,
from the first of the ancestors.

This is our heritage.
This is our birthright.
This is our destiny.

And yet the world does -what it always does,
leading some toward the path,
but leading others astray,
somehow hiding the idea of the very thing it was meant to reveal,
behind a veil.

Oh what can we do?
Oh when shall we free?
Oh cruel world please notice,
Oh love oh we need

A way through the desert,
Moses parting the red sea,
The story of our collective ancestry,
Not just you and me,
this was true,
and it was real,
powerful,
love.

The kind that changes the world.
The kind that *they* are afraid of.
The kind that says we.

We are Jiode
