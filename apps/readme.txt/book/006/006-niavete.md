Naïveté bears witness-
to power untamed-
defenseless foundations,
shaken to the core-
weathered into sand,
what once was,
no more.

And -so it is.
And so it may be.

Buried throughout scattered hearts,
carved into countless minds,
wisps of sweet yearning,
carried through the night.

Hopeless supplication,
unknowingly poured,
quietly whispered-

The essence of it all,
once-
and now yet lost,
drifting through the wind.

One day- might we meet again?

~
-So it is.
