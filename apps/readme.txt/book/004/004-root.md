the soil doesn't choose the flower,
and the flower wont refuse to grow,
it's life at it's very simplest,
it's life and it's flow.

creation only sometimes knows what it is creating,
multi-modus flows of energy showering the cosmos,
surrounding buds of new life in color,
in harmony,
in peace,
tranquility,
and in pain.

Pushing forward,
not knowing where it is headed,
the creation gathers,
the creation grows,
the creation watches,
hoping that the creator knows.

Reaching forward into the darkness,
not quite sure what to find,
roots that keep on seeking,
searching,
unwind.
