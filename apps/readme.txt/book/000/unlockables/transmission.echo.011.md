[signal decoded / partial memory reconstruction]

The city had no doors.
Only invitations.

Streets wound like thought —
each intersection a choice
you never realized you made.

Its people didn’t speak.
They harmonized.
(We called it “language,” but that was wrong.)

And at the center of it all —
a pool of still water
where the stars came to remember themselves.
