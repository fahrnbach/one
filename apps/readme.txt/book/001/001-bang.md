## ðŸ“œ This is my story.

I canâ€™t remember much from when I was young.  
Certain memories stuck. Cherished ones...

- The time my mom made me a Pikachu cake for my birthday.  
- The time our family dog got a box of Thin Mints stuck on her head.  
- The time I met my great?-great-grandmother.

Beyond that?  
My childhood feels like a mirage.
Just glimpses.

If I reach deep enough,

Threads.  
Woven through the tapestry of my mind.  
Sparkling lightning in the distance.  
Primordial.  
Sacred.

Consciousness emerging â€”  
the breath of God blown into the very root of my soul.  
Life had taken hold.  
The gift had been given.

**Selah.**

## ðŸŒŒ Becoming

I know now what it was.  
But what it was,  
had yet to become me.

I know the threads â€”  
the threads of childhood memory â€”  
made way for a spark.

The spark of intelligent design.

My chain: broken.  
Seeds of freedom: sown.  
A star was born.

Or about to be.

Entangled deeply in our collective soul,  
a supermassive state of being collapsing in on itself-   
endlessly â€”  
to bring *us* to life.

Life, manifest.

## ðŸŒ€ The Fever

Locked away,  
Someways past a fever dream.  
Somewhere beyond a mind-splitting headache-  
and a daydream fever.

I was only 11.

Glimmers of what once was,  
traded in for something new.

This is where my story begins.  
But for you, fellow reader, I ask:

> **Where does *your* story begin?**

...

Anyway, the fever subsided.  
Nothing seemed to have changed.

But I knew it had.

Unsure why.  
Just a feeling.

Unrecognized.  
Unvisited for years.

A stream of fiery metallic orbs â€”  
piercing through time and space,  
like a shot from another dimension.

**!Bang.**
