Pouring in countless,
Pour in again,
I've given it all,
I'd give it again.
Pushed the goal further,
the more that I knew,
leaving me faster,
get through.
get through.

I couldn't give up,
I just had to win,
the answer was knowing,
the knower within

And so I did keep,
and so I'd defend,
and so I kept on-
And kept on again.
