Deciding to become Stronger. Forcing yourself to go on.
Standing up again, 
Even when you'd already been knocked down

False win at the end of this chapter:
Make reader feel like it is all going good
Get the reader prepared to dream with you

Next Chapter:
Start at the place where you'd given up.
The Hardware store.

(Unexpected lessons learned there though)
