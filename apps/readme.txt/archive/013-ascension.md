Banished from from heaven,
fallen from grace,
perishing stanchions,
guarded the place,

the place where I lay,
not a house -not a home,
though no one could answer,
the crushing alone.

And yet it there did.
yet it there appeared,
the slightest thin thread,
made up of tears

at first apathetic,
oblivions peak,
the weaver did spook,
the string-ed of streaks.

so it did spin,
so it was sewn,
so it had pulled,
so it is grown.

and so it went up,
and so it became,
ascension from crush,
ignition aflame,

Accelerating-
Growing-
Faster-

Finally.

Graced
