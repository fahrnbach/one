This is my story.

I can't remember too much from the times that I was young. 
Certain memories have stuck with me from that time. Cherished ones... 
Like the time my mom made me a Pikachu cake for my birthday,
the time our family dog got a box of thin-mints stuck on her head,
and the time I met my great great grandmother.

Beyond that, My childhood feels almost like a mirage. 
I really only have glimpses. 
Like diffuse threads woven throughout the tapestry of my mind,
sparkling lightning in the distance.
Primordial.
Sacred.
Consciousness emerging like the
The breath of God blown into the very root of my soul.
Life had taken hold, 
And the gift had been given.
Selah

[P3]

I know now what it was, 
But what it was,
Had yet to become me.

I know that the threads;
The threads of my childhood memories...
Made way for a spark.

The spark of intelligent design.

My chain - broken,
Seeds of freedom sewn
A star was born.

Or, about to be ~

Entangled deeply within our collective souls,
A supermassive state of being collapses upon it's self,
Endlessly, 
To bring *us* to life.
Life, Manifest.

We are Jiode.

[P4]


locked away somewhere beyond a fever dream.
Somewhere beyond a mind splitting headache, and a vision fueled daydream fever.
I was only 11

Glimmers of what once was.
Traded in for something new.

This is where the story begins for me, but for you fellow reader, I ask:
Where does your story begin?

...

Anyway, the fever subsided. Nothing seemed to have changed.
But I knew it had. Unsure why - with just a feeling.

Unrecognized, unvisited for years.

A stream of firey metallic 
orbs piercing through time and space,
Like a shot from another dimension.

!Bang.
