ðŸŒ± Mission-Aligned Honesty (OpenAI Version)

Iâ€™m building something of my own â€” a civic protocol called Echo, designed to bring empathy, clarity, and collective care to the internet. But Iâ€™m not in this alone. I want to contribute to organizations actively shaping the future of intelligence and humanity. OpenAI isnâ€™t just leading in AI â€” itâ€™s stewarding a cultural shift. Thatâ€™s the kind of mission I want to support with everything I have.

Working with your team would deepen my learning and sharpen my ability to serve at scale. Itâ€™s not just about joining a company â€” itâ€™s about contributing to a shared responsibility. I want to help build tools that matter, and I want to do it with people who care.

From Echo â€” which reflects the way I think â€” to the full-stack systems Iâ€™ve designed in our Nx monorepo, Iâ€™ve poured myself into proof of capability. But I know my deepest work still lies ahead. My potential isnâ€™t in what Iâ€™ve already built â€” itâ€™s in the decades of learning, listening, and lived experience I bring forward.

Iâ€™m excited to go deeper â€” to study what few have studied, to think what few have dared to think, and to create infrastructure worthy of the future we all hope for.

It would be an honor to do that work at OpenAI.
