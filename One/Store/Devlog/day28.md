## 🪐 Overview

Today was about *layers*.

We transformed our teaser page from a static collection point into a **three-layered invitation funnel** that feels like a small adventure:
- Casual users are gently onboarded.
- The brave discover the "challenge" layer with fun shake animations and upside-down hints.
- The relentlessly curious find a hidden VIP area, rewarded for their curiosity.

Simultaneously, we refined our **meta systems**: devlog templates, social snippets, and the structural alignment that will carry this work forward.
