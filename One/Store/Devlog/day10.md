## 🚀 T Minus Day 10...9...8...

> 🟡 Retrospective: “Felt like prepping a rocket for orbit — wiring systems, patching bugs, and aligning engines for liftoff.”

---

**Highlights:**

- 🚀 Scaffolded a **Starlight-powered Astro documentation site** at `docs.fahrnbach.one`
- 🧱 Integrated into the Nx monorepo under `apps/docs` and resolved routing quirks
- 🗂️ Structured top-level content folders: `core/`, `meta/`, `guides/`, `sandbox/`, and more
- 🧭 Configured `sidebar.mjs` to override `_category_.json` and fully control nav structure
- 🐉 Defeated the **Astro Sidebar Dragon** (case-sensitive slugs + root folder overrides)
- 🪄 Created rich internal docs: `monorepo-quirks.md`, `lint-frontmatter.md`, `observations.md`
- 📒 Drafted modular SparkDocs for system features (Omnibar, Genie, CMS, Routing, Layout)
- 🧠 Launched the **Observations Log**: A scrollable log of bugs and gotchas
- 💡 Introduced tips like double-quoting YAML frontmatter and consistent casing
- 🌅 Established dev series: **Dev Spark ⚡️** and **Zendex 🧘**
- 🧪 Explored Open Graph image strategy for meta previews (for eventual `meta-worker`)
- 💬 Stubbed `/logs`, `/futuredx`, `/meta/tips`, `/meta/troubleshooting`, and `/meta/logs`
- ✨ Designed a vibrant `metaSidebar` with emoji-coded clarity and nested groups

**Summary:**

This was the day we stopped “building docs” and started **worldbuilding**.

In transforming a fresh Astro Starlight install into a living, searchable, multi-tab knowledge hub, we laid the groundwork for everything else to thrive. Between the sidebar config, folder structure, DX tips, and internal logs, this wasn’t just a deployment — it was a **platform alignment**.

We’re documenting more than files — we’re mapping the *fabric* of the Fahrnbach multiverse. Each post, tab, and log is a star in a growing constellation.

---

**Intent:**

To construct a living, extensible, and scalable documentation layer — one that informs, onboards, inspires, and self-heals as we grow. The docs are no longer just support materials… they’re the foundation.

---

**Lessons Learned:**

- 🔠 Astro folder names are case-sensitive — always use lowercase in `src/content/docs/`
- 🚧 `sidebar.mjs` overrides `_category_.json` — use only one at a time
- 🧼 YAML frontmatter must use **double quotes** for special characters or apostrophes
- ♻️ Restart Astro dev server after editing sidebar config — hot reload won’t cut it
- 📚 Markdown consistency (indentation, casing, quotes) saves massive debugging time later

---

**Future Improvements:**

- 🧭 Add a `meta.md` overview page linking all sub-sections
- 🧠 Build a reusable Observations Log component
- 🧰 Create `lint-frontmatter.mjs` tool for frontmatter validation
- 🧼 Write a “Quick Fixes” index that links to relevant logs
- 🌐 Build dynamic Open Graph preview image generation via meta-worker
- 🎇 Add animated flares or spark trails when entering new doc sections

> 🧠 **Boss Battle Report:** Today we took down **Monorepo Gremlins** and the **Astro Sidebar Dragon**. Hard-won battles… but we came out victorious and better documented.
