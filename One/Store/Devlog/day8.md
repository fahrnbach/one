## 😌 Day 8: Houston we have a problem... I'm tired....

> ⚪️ Retrospective: “Rest is part of the process — not a pause, but a purpose.”

**Highlights:**
- Took a well-deserved break to recharge
- Reflected on the intense planning and system design from Day 8
- Allowed insights to settle before the next push forward

**Summary:**
After a long day of architectural ideation, today was all about stepping back and letting things breathe. No code. No config. Just rest — the kind that makes tomorrow's clarity possible.

**Intent:**
Return tomorrow with a full tank and clear priorities.
