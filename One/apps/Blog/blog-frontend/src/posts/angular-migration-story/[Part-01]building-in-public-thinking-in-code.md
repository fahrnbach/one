# ✨ Part 1: Building in Public, Thinking in Code - An Angular Migration Story
### 🧠 Why the Blog Comes First: A Look Inside My Mind

When I set out to build my portfolio, I knew the visuals would matter. Clean code, animated transitions, responsive layouts — all of it had to look polished. But somewhere between SVG icons and CSS gradients, a deeper truth revealed itself:

> 🎭 The portfolio speaks to the surface. The blog speaks to the soul.

The blog is my mental staging area — a place where architecture decisions, tradeoffs, breakthroughs, and failures all get unpacked. It’s where I think out loud — in markdown, in debugging logs, in color-coded diagrams and half-finished ideas.

🧱 **The Portfolio proves I can build.**  
🧠 **The Blog proves I can think.**

Every great engineer I admire has some form of a blog — even if it’s just a digital shoebox of notes. These writings are the raw materials of trust. They show how you reason, how you recover, how you level up.

For me, the blog isn’t just an accessory.
It’s the **command center** of my engineering voice.

## 🔭 How It Fits Into Operation Angular Ascendancy

As outlined in my [Angular Ascendancy Devlog](https://github.com/fahrnbach/one/discussions/4), I’ve broken down my roadmap into three phases:

- 🛠️ **Priority #1** — MVP Portfolio: resume, contact form, site polish
- 🚀 **Priority #2** — Outreach Upgrades: Angular rewrites, CMS, DX tooling
- 🧪 **Priority #3** — Long-term experiments & creative apps

Originally, the blog sat modestly in Priority #2. But the more I mapped it out, the more I realized:

> 🔎 This is the only place where hiring teams can actually see how I think.

So I’m changing course. I’m putting the blog first.

## 🧱 Rebuilding the Blog

## ✨ Putting the Blog First

I’m currently rebuilding the blog as an Angular app. It will:

- 🏷️ Support tags, categories, and search  
- 📱 Feature a beautiful mobile-first layout  
- 📚 Offer a more enjoyable reading experience  
- ✍️ Eventually include a built-in CMS via Supabase  

The current Devlog will feed into it — and in many ways, the Devlog has been the prototype.  
Short, focused updates. Markdown-based. Thoughtful but fast.

Soon, it will all come together. And when it does, the blog won’t be just a blog.

> 🧠 It’ll be my voice.  
> 🛠️ It’ll be my changelog.  
> 💼 It’ll be my best argument for being hired.

Thanks for reading.
