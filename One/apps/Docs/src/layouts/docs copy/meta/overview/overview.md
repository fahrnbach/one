## 🧭 Welcome to the Meta Layer

The `meta/` tab is our digital observatory — a space to reflect on the *how* and *why* behind this system, not just the *what*. It's where we document quirks, decisions, philosophies, and developer experience (DX) notes that don’t neatly fit into core modules like Nexus or Sesame.

Think of it as a developer's field journal:
- 🧪 Observations about tooling behavior
- 🛠 Workarounds for edge cases or bugs
- 🧘 Naming conventions, folder feng shui, and the occasional sidebar saga
- 🧠 Future DX improvements and automation ideas

## ✨ What's Inside?

You’ll find:
- **Tips & Troubleshooting**: A running list of “gotchas” (like why we use `.mjs`)
- **Philosophy & Conventions**: Rationale behind structural choices
- **Future DX Wishlist**: Ideas for improving tooling, linting, and automation
- **Zendex**: A lore-rich blog series exploring dev chaos with clarity and calm

## 🌀 Why It Matters

Maintaining strong documentation isn't just about code — it's about creating clarity in complexity. By sharing the reasoning behind choices, we make the system more maintainable, more human, and more fun to work with.
