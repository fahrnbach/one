## üß† Design Philosophy

- **Omnibar over Sidebar**: Intentionally built around a universal omnibar for smarter search and navigation.
- **Progressive UX**: Tools unlock gradually, reinforcing exploration, discovery, and skill growth.
- **Playful Transparency**: Systems are open, documented, and built for remixing, not gatekeeping.
- **HumanKIND Ethos**: Compassion, equity, and curiosity shape every layer.

- **Redis Sessions**: Used for rate limiting, riddle verification, and AI unlocks.
- **Markdown + Zod**: Content structure via strongly typed schemas.
- **NX Monorepo**: Shared builds, caching, and encapsulated apps for streamlined dev.

## üß≠ Philosophy and Intent

This is not just a portfolio. It's a living framework for showcasing ideas, collaboration, and vision. It‚Äôs a system to help others build ‚Äî or to build with you.

All tools are modular, remixable, and intended for growth. Everything open-sourced under MIT unless otherwise noted.

> Let‚Äôs build something kinder. Something more magical. Something ours.
