# ðŸ§­ Global Layout & Philosophy

The **nexus.fahrnbach.one** site is not just a hub â€” it's a design statement. This document outlines the key decisions behind the site's layout, navigation, and adaptive philosophy.

## Why No Sidebar?

Traditional sidebars are powerful, but often overwhelming on smaller screens or dynamic content-heavy sites. We opted instead for:

- ðŸ§  **Omnibar**: A central, always-accessible search & nav component that feels more like a command palette than a menu.
- ðŸ“± **MiniOmni on Mobile**: Instead of a traditional hamburger, we use a compact version of the Omnibar to encourage search and discovery over hierarchical clicks.

<Aside type="tip">
  The decision to prioritize search over browsing is inspired by developer tools like Spotlight, Raycast, and command palettes in modern IDEs.

## Global Sections

The layout supports the following consistent zones:

- **Omnibar** (top center)
- **Main Viewport** for active tab/app content
- **Contextual Footer** that adapts based on route

This reduces visual clutter while maximizing focus and adaptability.

## Other Design Guidelines

- Responsive-first philosophy
- Intentional whitespace
- Smooth motion and transitions
- Emphasis on legibility and hierarchy
- Light/dark theme support with fallback gradients

<Aside type="note">
  Future iterations may include a dockable sidebar for power users or keyboard-only navigation.
</Aside>

## Intent

To create a navigation experience that supports wonder and speed â€” balancing visual elegance with practical UX decisions for a growing constellation of interconnected tools.
