import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

The **Contact** tab at [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) serves as a central point of outreach. Whether you're a recruiter, journalist, collaborator, or someone who simply wants to say hello — this is the place.

<Aside type="note">
  While similar to a traditional “Press” page, this tab is more human-oriented. It invites connection, curiosity, and real conversation.

- 🧠 **For Collaborators:** Invite to explore [spark.fahrnbach.one](https://spark.fahrnbach.one) and open-source project pages.
- 🗞️ **For Press:** Quick links to key projects and founder story.

## Planned Features

- Verified contact badges (e.g. PGP, Keybase, or federated identity)

<Aside type="tip">
  Consider adding a “Why are you here?” dropdown prompt for richer intent-based connections.
