# 🕊️ Ethos

The **Ethos** tab on [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) is where we strip away the technical layers and speak plainly — soul to soul — about *why* we build.

<Aside type="note">
  This is not a traditional "mission statement." It's a living thread woven from purpose, personal story, and a vision for a better world.

## Overview

This space exists to anchor our work in meaning.

While the rest of the site explores what we build and how we build it — the **Ethos** tab explores *why*. It reflects the heartbeat behind the code, the art behind the interfaces, and the belief that humanKIND is worth building for.

## Intent

To hold space for honesty, vulnerability, and transformation.
To share a vision that others can resonate with, build on, or question.
To remind ourselves — and others — what matters most.
