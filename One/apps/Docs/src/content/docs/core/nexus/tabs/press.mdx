# ðŸ“š Press (Plot Twist)

Welcome to the **Press** tab on [nexus.fahrnbach.one](https://nexus.fahrnbach.one) â€” but letâ€™s be honest: if you're actually from the press, surprise! This isn't just your average press kit... it's the launchpad for **my books**.

<Aside type="note">
  If you're looking for official logos or bios, try the <a href="/nexus/media">Media tab</a> instead. This space is something more personal.

## Intent

To house not just documentation or tools â€” but *truths* told through story. These books are a synthesis of everything: the code, the mission, the spark, the struggle.

Whether youâ€™re a journalist, a reader, or someone just wandering by â€” youâ€™re welcome here.

<Aside type="tip">
  You could call this section the "soft center" of the nexus. If you're writing about this place, you'll probably want to start here â€” or at least *feel* here before you do.

The story is still being written â€” but so far, itâ€™s a good one.
