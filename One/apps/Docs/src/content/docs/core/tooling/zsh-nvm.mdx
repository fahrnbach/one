# ‚öôÔ∏è Zsh Dotfiles & NVM

This guide outlines how we use Zsh + NVM to manage developer environments with flair. From auto Node.js version switching to custom aliases and visuals, our dotfile setup is built for clarity, context, and maximum flow.

<Aside type="note">
A full post on the dotfiles philosophy and setup is coming soon to the <a href="/blog/devspark/zsh-dotfiles">DevSpark series</a>. Stay tuned!

## Overview

Zsh is our shell of choice ‚Äî paired with Oh-My-Zsh and a robust dotfile setup, we ensure quick context switching, custom prompts, and helpful dev shortcuts. NVM (Node Version Manager) allows us to pin Node.js versions on a per-project basis using `.nvmrc`.

---

## Features of Our Setup

- üåÄ Auto-switching to the correct Node version using `.nvmrc` and a simple hook in `.zshrc`
- üß† Kontext-aware prompts that show the current repo, project, and Node version
- ‚ú® Custom themes and spacing for legibility and aesthetics
- üß© Aliases galore (e.g. `gs` for `git status`, `rb` for `npm run build`, etc)
- üìÇ Directory-specific behaviors using conditional sourcing
- üß∞ Autoloaders for CLI tools like `nvm`, `pyenv`, `rbenv`, and more

---

## Why It Matters

When working across multiple Node projects (or mono-repos), keeping your local environment clean and consistent is crucial. Our setup:

- Reduces friction switching projects
- Prevents `node_modules` mismatches
- Encourages reproducible builds
- Makes the shell delightful to use

---

## Example `.zshrc` Snippet

```zsh
# Load NVM if it's not already loaded
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Auto-switch node version using .nvmrc
autoload -U add-zsh-hook

load-nvmrc() {
  if [ -f .nvmrc ]; then
    nvm use
  fi
}

add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
load-nvmrc
```

---

## Future Improvements

- Shell prompt integration with the Omnibar
- Auto-sourcing project-specific `.env` files
- Integration with task runners and component libraries

---

## Intent

To create a clean, delightful CLI experience that empowers devs ‚Äî and makes shell life just a little more magical.
