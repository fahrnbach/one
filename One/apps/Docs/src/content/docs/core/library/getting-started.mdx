## Overview

Welcome to the **Component Viewer & Library** — an extensible Angular site designed to index, display, and interactively search through reusable UI components.

Built with developer efficiency and future backend integration in mind, this tool enables full-stack maintainability and rapid visual exploration of your design system.

<Aside type="note">Everything in this tool is written in Angular and designed to run as a fully static or hosted app. It pairs well with monorepos or modular full-stack applications.</Aside>

---

## 🔍 Dynamic Fuzzy Search

The search experience is powered by a browser-local fuzzy matching system that:

- Crawls the component file structure.
- Parses frontmatter-like metadata from each component.
- Matches user queries by name, tag, or description.
- Responds in real-time with ranked matches and live previews.

<Aside type="tip">Search is powered in-browser today, but the metadata system is built to support a GraphQL or REST backend for remote querying in the future.</Aside>

---

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

- Components live in the `/components/` directory tree.
- Each component includes:
  - A metadata block (name, description, tags, date)
  - A live rendered preview
  - A code snippet
  - Optionally, a usage example or design notes

<Aside type="caution">Ensure metadata is properly formatted. Components missing required fields may be skipped by the viewer or cause rendering issues.</Aside>

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

This tool is built for **iterative extensibility**. Future additions may include:

- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload support
- ✅ File system sync for rapid prototyping
- ☁️ Cloud-based component syncing (R2 or GCS)
- 📂 Grouped previews by folder, tag, or type
- 🔐 Admin-only editing mode via CMS

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- A visual spec doc for internal teams
- Source of truth for consistent UI
- Live-previewable library for CMS editors
- Educational tool for onboarding developers

<Aside type="tip">Want to embed this tool in your main app or CMS? It's modular by design — just import the core module and configure your content root!</Aside>
