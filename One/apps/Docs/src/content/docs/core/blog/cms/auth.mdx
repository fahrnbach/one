## Overview

This document outlines early-stage plans for implementing authentication in our CMS, with the goal of creating a secure, modular, and extensible auth system that can be reused across apps.

<Aside type="note">This spec is still in progress. Expect rapid changes as we finalize integrations with third-party dependencies.</Aside>

## Current Goals

- 🔐 Protect CMS and admin dashboard routes
- 🌐 Enable secure federated login (OAuth2, possibly with GitHub/Google)
- 🛂 Support user roles (admin, editor, viewer)
- 🔄 Maintain auth state across sessions with refresh tokens

## Future Considerations

- 🧾 **Crypto Passport Integration**
  Explore decentralized identity systems or crypto-native login options for select admin use.

- 📦 **Drop-In Auth Module**
  Auth system should be decoupled enough to be dropped into other Angular-based apps we maintain (e.g., Nexus, Sesame).

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Audit Logging**
  Track access and mutations within the CMS for security auditing.

- 🔐 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  Add optional second-layer security for admin logins.

<Aside type="tip">We plan to separate UI concerns from auth logic to allow future migration from custom token-based auth to a third-party identity provider if needed.</Aside>

## Next Steps

- Define the auth schema
- Set up protected routes
- Integrate token validation middleware into GraphQL Yoga server
- Consider a fallback static login for local development mode
