Goodbye was never truly goodbye.
Not in the way that it was supposed to be.
Not in the way that one would want.
Goodbye was always messy.
A little bit of longing,
wrapped up in a mess of experience,
hoping for a way to make some kindness appear,
a kindness that gave grace to return to the way things were.

It did,

Goodbye.

Hello.

The simplest words,
The changers of worlds,
With every good story-
-that's ever been told.

It starts with hello,
could end with a kiss,
It goes on forever
and always it did.

Goodbye my love,
Hello, Goodbye,
Hello, Hello
Bye, Bye, Bye.

By and bye and into the mists,
we've shared all our lives,
with every which twist.

We've been here together, 
we leave here alone,
and if we have ever,
we'll meet once we're home.
