unmistakably barren,
alone,
without friendship,
without home,
without love,
alone.

Where had they gone?
what had i done?
what could i do?
where's every-one?

a bitter wind blew,
covered in damp,
it chilled to the bone,
threatening to extinguish,
a birthday's candle,
blown.

and so i did wish,
and so i did see,
and so i did know,

it started with me.
