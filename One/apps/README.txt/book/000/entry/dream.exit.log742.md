Imagine for a moment you have climbed a great mountain,
the air has become thin,
and the wind blows fierce.
You cling to the final wall,
nearing the summit.
Don't look down.

Triumphantly you pull yourself up,
over the edge,
on top of the world,
you pull one last time,
excitement meets exhaustion,
your tired muscles betray you,
your hand slips.

You may feel a sense of falling.  
This is normal.  

It means your story has been moved  
from memory  
to motion.

Bon voyage.  
We’ll see you again soon.
