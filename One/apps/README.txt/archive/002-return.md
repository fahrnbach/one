A sea of tranquility unfolding yet still,
the juxtaposition of our quiet will,
thinned up the gravity but bring down the rains,
exploding in silence.
silence against.

A surface; a bubbling rippling gateway,
echoing beams of light,
cascade through the portal,
showering us from the dance above,
igniting the world,
adorning in space,
our quietest solace,
this is the place

Don oh the armor,
don oh the pace,
don oh the raiments,
when you enter this race,

taken but given,
something replaced,
whisked into timeless,
thrown into grace
