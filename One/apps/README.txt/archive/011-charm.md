Nevermind that it was temporary,
it was all we ever could have hoped for,
and more!
It was cozy,
it was charming,
it was tiny,
it was Ours!

Smiles cross the doorway,
Our hidden apartment,
So tender so sweet,
Together at last,
A warm and toasty,
bubbly, tasty, soft,
haze stuck to the doorway,
and lasted for days.

Meet at the door,
We got some new news!
We just found a splace,
one with a view!
On top of the hill,
atop of this place,
we'll stay *there* together,
I know we can place!

So it became, 
and so it did was,
our life stayed the same,
but not where we was,

We moved out of sweetness
We moved into gain,
We moved into warmness,
but not quite the same.

We moved into business,
A flickering flame,
kindling, 
burning brighter now!
it was starting to look like,
oh could it be real?
we'd gone to the courthouse,
signed with the seal,
Your mom at the airport,
helped make the deal,
before we quite knew it,
whoosh.
