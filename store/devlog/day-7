## 🚂 Day 7: All Aboard the Monorepo

> ⚫️ Retrospective: “Today was about laying track, not driving the train — but we’re ready to roll.”

**Highlights:**
- Initialized and configured **Nx monorepo** structure
- Migrated legacy Angular blog to `apps/blog-frontend`
- Cleaned up unused files and clarified project folder conventions (`src/` vs `public/`)
- Resolved `.zshrc` issues (including `nvm` context bugs)
- Unified `package.json` dependencies and scripts
- Set up `project.json` with custom build targets and assets
- Pruned legacy `angular.json`, `.editorconfig`, and `.vscode` where appropriate

**Summary:**
Today was a foundational refactor. We took a standalone Angular blog and began its transformation into a fully modular Nx workspace. From rewriting file paths and asset references to reworking SSR/prerender logic, this was about *future-proofing*. The monorepo is now clean, aligned, and ready to scale.
+ The groundwork is laid for a successful SSG setup — now we can focus on making the blog truly shine.

**Intent:**
Prepare the groundwork for further modularization and feature development — including SSG, client-side islands, and shared component libraries.

**Lessons Learned:**
+ Don’t blindly trust defaults — especially when migrating. Understand how assets, build targets, and executors behave in Nx.
- `.zshrc` bugs can silently cascade into your CLIs (watch for broken `nvm`, especially).
- The public vs src distinction is deeper than it looks — Read the full post ->[blog.fahrnbach.one/src-vs-public-bakery](https://blog.fahrnbach.one/src-vs-public-bakery)

**Future Improvements:**
- Scaffold `server.ts` + `main.server.ts` for SSR/SSG setup
- Add Husky + Prettier + lint-staged for pre-commit hygiene
- Create `HotPostsComponent` to test dynamic client-only behavior
