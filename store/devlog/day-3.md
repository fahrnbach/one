## ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’» Day -3: Frontend Prototyping for Admin Panel
```
ðŸŸ¡ **Retrospective:** This summary represents foundational work done before public commits.
```
**Highlights:**
- Built `admin-login.html`, `dashboard.html` + minimal styles.
- Learned how Express serves static assets.
- Clarified how HTML file paths work in relation to static routes.

**Summary:**
The first tangible (backend) UI elements appeared. The admin interface moved from concept to screen, supported by lessons learned around static asset routing and layout logic. This marked the beginning of a working surface for authentication and real-time metric visibility.

**Intent:**
Kickstart the visual layer of the admin portal and test Expressâ€™s static file handling. The goal was to create a minimal but functional UI for login and dashboard views â€” enough to validate routing, state flow, and prepare for styling and interactivity.
