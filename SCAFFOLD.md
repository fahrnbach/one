>What is a good top level folder structure?

Iâ€™m finding that a lot of the apps Iâ€™ve got in my front end folder actually contain some serverless functions too!

Are they still considered frontend? Or should I create an Apps or a Subdomains folder?

Whatâ€™s the convention here?

Great question â€” organizing your project at the top-level becomes especially important as you scale. Since youâ€™re managing multiple apps, subdomains, and serverless functions, hereâ€™s a breakdown of conventional patterns and a suggested strategy tailored to your setup:

ðŸ§± Recommended Structure with Frontend + Backend
/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                            # All deployable units (frontend + backend)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ art-app-frontend/            # Angular or static frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ art-app-backend/             # Express/Nest/Fastify/etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog.fahrnbach.one/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sesame.fahrnbach.one/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fahrnbach.one/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/                        # Shared libs, types, components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ genie-assistant/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared-ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db-client/                   # (e.g. Prisma client or Supabase wrapper)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validation-schemas/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                         # One-off utility scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ seed-db.ts
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                            # Internal documentation or architecture notes
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                          # Global assets
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/                         # GitHub workflows, templates
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                     # Can include top-level dev dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.base.json

Why Use /apps Instead of /frontend
	â€¢	Clarity: Not everything is purely frontend anymore â€” some folders have metadata workers, Cloudflare logic, etc.
	â€¢	Scalability: apps/ scales naturally if you add a marketing site, API gateway, admin panel, etc.
	â€¢	Convention: Popular monorepos (e.g., Nx, Turborepo) use apps/ and packages/ as defaults.

  And adopt the apps/ + packages/ model. It communicates professionalism, separates concerns cleanly, and will help you (and recruiters!) understand the architecture at a glance.

  If youâ€™re using tooling like Nx or Turborepo, you can add tags or labels:

  ```
  {
  "name": "art-app-backend",
  "tags": ["type:backend", "scope:art-app"]
}
  ```

  Helps organize large monorepos with linting, deployment boundaries, etc.
